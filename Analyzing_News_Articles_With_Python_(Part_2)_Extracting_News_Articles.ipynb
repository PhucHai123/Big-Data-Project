Kennedy School of Government, on the campus of Harvard University, in Cambridge, Mass. The husband of a woman who died accidentally in an office of then-GOP Rep. Joe Scarborough two decades ago is demanding that Twitter remove President Donald Trump’s tweets suggesting Scarborough murdered her. (AP Photo/Steven Senne, File)\\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump escalated his war on Twitter and other social media companies Thursday, signing an executive order challenging the lawsuit protections that have served as a bedrock for unfettered speech on the internet.\\nAnnounced with fanfare, the president’s action yet appeared to be more about politics than substance. He aims to rally supporters after he lashed out at Twitter for applying fact checks to two of his tweets.\\nTrump said the fact checks were “editorial decisions” by Twitter amounting to political activism and that such actions should cost social media companies their liability protection for what is posted on their platforms.\\nTrump, who personally relies heavily on Twitter to verbally flog his foes, has long accused the tech giants in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley of targeting conservatives by fact-checking them or removing their posts.\\n“We’re fed up with it,” Trump said, claiming his order would uphold freedom of speech.\\nTechnology industry groups disagreed, saying it would stifle innovation and speech on the internet. And the U.S. Chamber of Commerce objected, “Regardless of the circumstances that led up to this, this is not how public policy is made in the United States.”\\nThe executive order directs executive branch agencies to ask independent rule-making agencies including the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission to study whether they can place new regulations on the companies — though experts express doubts much can be done without an act of Congress.\\nFCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement: “This debate is an important one. The Federal Communications Commission will carefully review any petition for rulemaking filed by the Department of Commerce.”\\nCompanies like Twitter and Facebook are granted liability protection under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act because they are treated as “platforms,” rather than “publishers,” which can face lawsuits over content.\\nA similar executive order was previously considered by the administration but shelved over concerns it couldn’t pass legal muster and that it violated conservative principles on deregulation and free speech.\\n“They’ve had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences,” Trump said of social media companies as he prepared to sign the order. “There is no precedent in American history for so small a number of corporations to control so large a sphere of human interaction.”\\nTrump and his campaign reacted after Twitter added a warning phrase to two Trump tweets that called mail-in ballots “fraudulent” and predicted “mail boxes will be robbed.” Under the tweets, there’s now a link reading “Get the facts about mail-in ballots” that guides users to a page with fact checks and news stories about Trump’s unsubstantiated claims .\\nTrump accused Twitter of interfering in the 2020 presidential election” and declared “as president, I will not allow this to happen.” His campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said Twitter’s “clear political bias” had led the campaign to pull “all our advertising from Twitter months ago.” In fact, Twitter has banned political advertising since last November.\\nLate Wednesday, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted, “We’ll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally.”\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nOn the other hand, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Fox News his platform has “a different policy, I think, than Twitter on this.”\\n“I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn’t be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,” he said.\\nThe president’s critics, meanwhile, scolded the platforms for allowing him to put forth false or misleading information that could confuse voters.\\nOregon Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat and advocate for internet freedoms, said Trump was “desperately trying to steal for himself the power of the courts and Congress. ... All for the ability to spread unfiltered lies.”\\nTrump’s proposal has multiple, serious legal problems and is unlikely to survive a challenge, according to Matt Schruers, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a Washington-based organization that represents computer and internet companies.\\nIt would also seem to be an assault on the same online freedom that enabled social media platforms to flourish in the first place — and made them such an effective microphone for Trump and other politicians.\\n“The irony that is lost here is that if these protections were to go away social media services would be far more aggressive in moderating content and terminating accounts,” Schruers said. “Our vibrant public sphere of discussion would devolve into nothing more than preapproved soundbites.”\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it was “outrageous” that while Twitter had put a fact-check tag on Trump’s tweets asserting massive mail-in election fraud, it had not removed his tweets repeating a debunked conspiracy theory that a TV news host had murdered an aide years ago.\\nThe president and fellow conservatives have been claiming, for years, that Silicon Valley tech companies are biased against them. But there is no evidence for this — and while the executives and many employees of Twitter, Facebook and Google may lean liberal, the companies have stressed they have no business interest in favoring one political party over the other.\\nThe trouble began in 2016, two years after Facebook launched a section called “trending,” using editors to curate popular news stories. Zuckerberg met with prominent right-wing leaders at the time in an attempt at damage control, and in 2018, Facebook shut down the “trending” section,.\\nIn August 2018, Trump accused Google of biased searches and warned the company to “be careful.” Google pushed back sharply, saying Trump’s claim simply wasn’t so, and experts suggested his comments showed a misunderstanding of how search engines work.\\nLast year, Trump again blasted social media companies after Facebook banned a slew of extremist figures including conspiracy peddler Alex Jones from its site and from Instagram.\\nMeanwhile, the companies are gearing up to combat misinformation around the November elections. Twitter and Facebook have begun rolling out dozens of new rules to avoid a repeat of the false postings about the candidates and the voting process that marred the 2016 election.\\nThe coronavirus pandemic has further escalated the platforms’ response, leading them to take actions against politicians — a move they’ve long resisted — who make misleading claims about the virus.\\nLast month, Twitter began a “Get the Facts” label to direct social media users to news articles from trusted outlets next to tweets containing misleading or disputed information about the virus.\\nAs the White House claimed that Trump was the subject of a fact check but Chinese disinformation about the coronavirus was not, Twitter moved Thursday to add a warning to a March tweet from a Chinese government spokesman falsely claiming the U.S. military spread the virus.\\nEven as he and his supporters complain of bias on the platform, Trump has used Twitter to build a potent and vocal online following. The president’s account currently has more than 80 million followers.\\nTrump’s success on social media suggests that his proposal may be more about politics than an actual interest in regulation, according to Rutgers University media professor John Pavlik, who studies the impact of technology on society and government.\\nPavlik said that by trying to intimidate the platforms now, he’s seeking to control how the 2020 campaign plays out online and “about appealing to his base.”\\n___\\nAP writers Amanda Seitz, Barbara Ortutay and David Klepper contributed.'], 'http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/05/news/economy/trump-steel-aluminum-tariffs-support/index.html': ['.cnn.com', \"Who likes tariffs?

Usually it\\'s groups that are pretty critical of the Trump administration.\\nFor example, the United Steelworkers union and the AFL-CIO were among the strongest supporters of the proposal.

Dianne Feinstein of California, highlighted Horowitz’s finding that the FBI had a legitimate basis to open the investigation into the Trump campaign in July 2016. She said that conclusion undercut Trump’s repeated claims that he was the target of a vendetta by FBI officials.\\n“This was not a politically-motivated investigation. There is no ‘Deep State,’” Feinstein said. “Simply put, the FBI investigation was motivated by fact, not bias. … The FBI was obligated to investigate possible Russian ties to the Trump campaign.”\\nFeinstein also faulted Barr for continuing to claim publicly that it is possible the FBI’s Russia probe was tainted by political motivations.\\n“I believe strongly that it’s time to move on from the false claims of political bias,” she said.\\nDemocrats downplayed the numerous failures detailed in Horowitz’s 400-plus-page report and pointed out that FBI Director Christopher Wray had promised to address them.\\nThe inspector general let most of those characterizations pass without comment, although when Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) referred to “several errors” in the FISA process, Horowitz did chime in.\\n“Maybe more than several,” he said, alluding to his report’s identification of 17 significant facts that the FBI omitted or misstated in its submissions to the FISA court.\\nDespite claims by Feinstein and other Democrats that the watchdog had essentially cleared the FBI of claims that bias affected the investigation, Horowitz declared later in the exchange on Wednesday that inaccuracies and omissions relating to the Page surveillance were so numerous and inexplicable that he could not say there was no intentional misconduct or improper purpose at work.\\n“It is unclear what the motivations were,” the inspector general said. “We were not able to make that conclusion.”\\nHowever, Graham warned his Democratic colleagues not to dismiss Horowitz’s findings solely because Trump was the target of the FBI.\\n“It’s Trump today, it could be you or me tomorrow,” the chairman said. “There is a mountain of misconduct. Please don’t ignore it.”\\nGraham blasted the FBI for not briefing then-candidate Donald Trump during the campaign about the specific threats that agents perceived from Russia.\\n“They never made any effort to brief Donald Trump about suspected problems in his campaign. … Why did they not tell him that?” the chairman asked.\\nGraham was also critical of the FBI’s decision to send an agent working on the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, as the Russia probe was named internally, to a more generic defensive briefing that the bureau did for the Trump campaign.\\nWray has agreed not to do that again — at least with briefings to a presidential nominee’s campaign. But not every senator agreed that the FBI tactic the bureau deployed in 2016 was outrageous.\\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) noted that Michael Flynn, a key Trump adviser, was at the time a focus of a counterintelligence investigation by the FBI. He later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI while serving as national security adviser in the White House and is awaiting sentencing.\\n“It was an unusual circumstance that a participant in that briefing on the part of the Trump campaign was the subject of an FBI investigation,” Whitehouse said. “We should not draw the conclusion that there’s no way that the FBI should ever be given access to evidence that arises in the course of an intelligence briefing.”\\nGraham used a sizable chunk of his lengthy opening statement to read anti-Trump text messages exchanged by a top FBI agent on the Russia probe, Peter Strzok, and an FBI attorney, Lisa Page. The South Carolina Republican said the messages were improper for anyone involved in such a probe, though the report notes that neither Strzok nor Page were in charge of the investigation.\\nGraham did not mention that the inspector general found pro-Trump texts sent by other agents dealing with the Russia probe, nor did the senator revisit his own cutting criticism of Trump during the 2016 campaign.\\nGraham faulted the FBI for assigning agents and lawyers who had strong views about Trump to the Russia investigation. He did not explain how FBI supervisors should have known about the political leanings of those involved, given legal prohibitions on using political views in staffing decisions.\\nComey has claimed that the report’s finding vindicates him against claims of mounting a biased, unjustified investigation, but in response to a question from Graham, Horowitz said the part of the probe that focused on Page is something no one at the FBI should be proud of.\\n“I think the activities we found here don’t vindicate anybody who touched this FISA,” the inspector general said.\\nDespite the partisan divide evident at the hearing, there was some consensus that the inspector general’s findings could complicate the process for renewing certain surveillance authorities that recently got a short-term extension set to expire next March.\\nGraham said he’d been too quick in the past to dismiss warnings from colleagues such as Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) that FISA oversight was weak and the system was susceptible to abuse.\\nLee opened his comments on Wednesday by slamming what he called Democrats’ “absolutely crazy” take on the new report, but went on to say the findings demonstrated that his predictions about the surveillance regime had proven prescient.\\n“It calls into question the legitimacy of the whole FISA program,” Lee said. “This really pushes us over the edge. … Every American really should be terrified by this report.”\\nAnother longtime critic of that surveillance process, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), pointed to the long history of inaccurate claims and broken promises by the government to the secretive court. He went on to say that he welcomed the new skepticism from some Republicans about those powers.\\n“Let’s have a fulsome conversation after this about the future of the FISA court and the representations that are made to it,” Durbin said.'], 'https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exclusive-hiding-plain-sight-hunter-biden-defends-foreign/story?id=66275416': ['abcgo.com', \"Exclusive: 'I'm here': Hunter Biden hits back at Trump taunt in exclusive ABC News interview\", 'Abc News', datetime.datetime(2019, 10, 15, 17, 3), 'As President Donald Trump continues to fill his Twitter feed and campaign speeches with attacks on Hunter Biden over his foreign business deals, the former vice president\\'s son defended the ethical implications of his private ventures in an interview with ABC News, but conceded taking a misstep in failing to foresee the political implications on his father\\'s career.\\n\"In retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part. Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don\\'t believe now, when I look back on it -- I know that there was -- did nothing wrong at all,\" Hunter Biden told ABC News in an exclusive interview. \"However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is...a swamp in — in — in many ways? Yeah.\"\\n\"I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That\\'s where I made the mistake,\" said Biden. \"So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.\"\\nNo topic was off-limits when Biden sat down with ABC News\\' Amy Robach over the weekend, including how the spotlight on his personal and professional life has threatened his ongoing struggle with addiction. It\\'s his first broadcast interview since attracting the attention of Trump, who posed this question to his 66 million Twitter followers last week: \"WHERE\\'S HUNTER?\"\\n\"I\\'m here. I\\'m here and I\\'m working and I\\'m living my life,\" Hunter Biden retorted from his Los Angeles home. \"Hiding in plain sight, I guess.\"\\n\"Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah,\" he said, again referring to fallout from his overseas business. \"But did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not.\"\\nBiden said, \"I take -- full responsibility for that. Do I -- did I do anything improper? No, and not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever. I joined a board, I served honorably. I did -- I focused on corporate governance. I didn\\'t have any discussions with my father before or after I joined the board as it related to it, other than that brief exchange that we had.\"\\nEven so, the 49-year-old has maintained a low profile in recent months as the president and his allies have targeted Hunter Biden for his professional endeavors in Ukraine and China.\\nHunter Biden told ABC News he does not specifically regret those business ventures, but wishes he had anticipated future attacks from his father\\'s political rivals. \"What I regret is not taking into account that there would be a Rudy Giuliani and a president of the United States that would be listening to this -- this ridiculous conspiracy idea.\"\\nTrump\\'s overtures to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden has led to a burgeoning impeachment inquiry in Congress. When a transcript of the call revealed the president\\'s repeated references to the Bidens, Hunter described his reaction as being \"like every other American -- I was shocked.\"\\nABC\\'s Amy Robach talks with Hunter Biden during an exclusive interview. ABC News\\nSoon after reading the transcript released by the White House, Hunter picked up the phone and called his father. Hunter said his father asked him about his daughter, Maisy, before getting into the big news.\\n\"For real. And that\\'s not a joke. I mean, and then discussion was literally like, \\'Oh my gosh,\\'\" the younger Biden told ABC News, describing their mutual surprise at the nature of the transcript. \"But other than that, really, I want to make it clear, it\\'s not like anybody has to have any discussion beyond that.\"\\nHunter Biden reiterated that he never discussed his foreign business dealings with his father, and made it clear he has no interest in becoming a political football as congressional Democrats haul witnesses in for depositions as part of their impeachment proceedings.\\n\"I\\'ll let Congress handle that,\" he said. \"And I\\'ll let you guys in the media handle that. And I\\'ll let my dad\\'s campaign handle that. And the only thing that I\\'m looking to handle is to make certain that I get up every day and do the next right thing. And that really is the way that I\\'ve been trying to live my life.\"\\nDespite his desire to stay out of the spotlight, ethics experts told ABC News that Hunter Biden\\'s role on the board of a Ukrainian oil and gas company called Burisma, while his father fronted U.S. foreign policy toward Kyiv, could present an ethical conundrum -- an allegation Hunter fervently disputed.\\nBiden spoke with conviction when asked about how much information he shared with his father and even whether he was qualified.\\n\"[My father] read the press reports that I\\'d joined the board of Burisma which was a Ukrainian natural gas company. And there\\'s been a lot of misinformation about me, not about my dad. Nobody buys Dad. But -- by this idea that I was unqualified to be on the board,\" said Biden.\\n\"I was vice chairman of the board of Amtrak for five years,\" he continued. \"I was the chairman of the board of the U.N. World Food Program. I was a lawyer for Boies Schiller Flexner, one of the most prestigious law firms in -- in the world.\"\\n\"I think that I had as much knowledge as anybody else that was on the board -- if not more.\"\\nEven so, on Sunday the Biden campaign released details of a proposed government ethics plan, which included a stipulation designed to \"rein in executive branch financial conflicts of interest\" -- an apparent response to allegations lodged against the Biden family. And while he cited being a lawyer at a prominent firm and his record serving on several boards as qualifications for the job, in his interview with ABC News, Hunter Biden acknowledged that his last name likely played a role in his Burisma board appointment.\\n\"If your last name wasn\\'t Biden,\" Robach asked, \"do you think you would\\'ve been asked to be on the board of Burisma?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know. Probably not, in retrospect,\" he said. \"But that\\'s -- you know -- I don\\'t think that there\\'s a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn\\'t Biden.\"\\n\"Because my dad was vice president of the United States. There\\'s literally nothing, as a young man or as a full grown adult that -- my father in some way hasn\\'t had influence over. It does not serve either one of us,\" Biden continued.\\nABC\\'s Amy Robach talks with Hunter Biden during an exclusive interview. ABC News\\nOn the same day the Biden campaign rolled out their government ethics plan, a lawyer for Hunter Biden announced that his client would step down from the board of directors of a Chinese-backed private equity company by the end of this month -- and commit to halting all work with foreign entities if his father wins the White House in 2020.\\n\"I\\'m taking it off the table, Amy,\" Hunter Biden said of his decision to step away from any foreign businesses. \"I\\'m making that commitment. Let\\'s see if anybody else makes that commitment. But that\\'s the commitment that I\\'m making.\"\\n\"Look, I\\'m a private citizen,\" he said. \"One thing that I don\\'t have to do is sit here and open my kimono as it relates to how much money I make or make or did or didn\\'t. But it\\'s all been reported.\"\\nIn a press conference over the weekend, Joe Biden said the decision \"represents the kind of man of integrity [Hunter] is.\" The president took the opportunity to recast the decision as Hunter \"being forced to leave a Chinese Company.\"\\nWhile the congressional impeachment inquiry focuses, for the time being, squarely on the president\\'s interactions with Ukrainian officials, Trump\\'s more recent line of attack against the Bidens has targeted Hunter\\'s Chinese business venture. Earlier this month, Trump called on Beijing to launch an investigation into the matter.\\n\"The Biden family was PAID OFF, pure and simple!\" Trump tweeted earlier this month, echoing an accusation raised by his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. The president and his allies have accused Hunter Biden of banking $1.5 billion from the joint investment firm, a figure Hunter Biden called \"crazy\" and \"has no basis in fact in any way.\"\\nReports at the time indicated Hunter Biden\\'s firm sought to raise $1.5 billion for the fund -- not that either he or his firm pocketed $1.5 billion from the deal.\\n\"They feel like they have the license to go out and say whatever they want,\" Hunter Biden said. \"It\\'s insane to even -- it feels to me like living in some kind of, you know, \\'Alice in Wonderland,\\' where you\\'re up on the real world and then you fall down the rabbit hole, and, you know, the president\\'s the Cheshire Cat asking you questions about crazy things that don\\'t bear any resemblance to the reality of anything that has to do with me.\"\\nDespite Hunter Biden\\'s dismissal of the $1.5 billion figure attached to his investment in the firm, ethics experts have said his connection with the Chinese-based corporation again raises the potential for the appearance of a conflict of interest, particularly in light of the fact that Hunter Biden flew with his father to Beijing aboard Air Force Two in 2013 -- around the time the deal was negotiated.\\n\"I\\'ve traveled everywhere with my dad,\" Biden said. \"And I went [to China in 2013] because my daughter was on the trip too.\"\\nHunter Biden\\'s lawyer said he has yet to receive a financial return on investment, adding that he only became a minority stakeholder in the company in October 2017 – after Joe Biden was no longer vice president. Prior to then, he served as an unpaid director.\\nAgain, Biden insists he never spoke of his professional dealings with his father on the 13-hour flight. And while he insists he did not engage in any business during the visit, he told The New Yorker in July that he did meet with a business partner, Jonathan Li, and even organized Li to shake hands with his father.\\nABC\\'s Amy Robach talks with Hunter Biden. ABC News\\nAsked about that interaction, Hunter Biden said he could not remember it specifically, but said he \"probably\" introduced them, and in fact \"hoped\" he had – adding that he had been friends with Li for 13 years.\\n\"Whether I\\'m in New York, or whether I\\'m in Washington, D.C., or whether I\\'m on the campaign trail in Nevada, or whether I am in Iowa with him -- [and] a friend and a business associate is in the hotel, and my dad\\'s staying there -- is it inappropriate for me to have coffee with him?\" Biden asked rhetorically.\\nRobach pressed the matter, though, asking Hunter what he would say to those \"who believe this is exactly why people hate Washington.\"\\n\"I don\\'t know what to tell you. I made a mistake in retrospect as it related to creating any perception that that was wrong,\" Hunter Biden said. \"My dad has never made a decision about anything, I\\'m absolutely certain, taking into account anything other than what is best for the American people and what the people that elected him to do. I am 100% certain of that.\"\\nDespite the controversy, Biden maintains that the attention on his foreign business deals won\\'t harm his father\\'s campaign in the long run.\\n\"I think that they know who my dad is, and I think that they know that my dad is not Donald Trump,\" he said. \"I certainly hope that there is no negative political ramifications of this. I think that the truth always wins.\"\\nStill, Biden says, the toll of being in the president\\'s line of fire has placed a strain on his personal life -- even though he insists his relationship with his father is as strong as ever.\\n\"My dad doesn\\'t have to defend me. My dad only has to love me. And my dad loves me unequivocally,\" he said. \"And so [that is] one thing that he doesn\\'t have to get involved in because he knows that I am my own man and that I\\'m strong enough.\"\\nIn fact, he used the president\\'s attacks to draw a contrast between his father and Trump.\\n\"As it relates to whether he can take on Donald Trump, absolutely,\" he said. \"But my dad doesn\\'t go after other people\\'s kids. He just doesn\\'t. Never has.\"\\nABC\\'s Amy Robach talks with Hunter Biden. ABC News\\nBut as far as being a target for President Trump, Biden insists he doesn\\'t care.\\n\"Being the subject of Donald Trump\\'s ire is a feather in my cap. It\\'s not something that I go to bed nervous about at night at all. The reason I\\'m able to do that is because I am absolutely enveloped in love of my family,\" said Biden.\\nTrump continued to target the younger Biden after this interview aired.\\n\"Hunter Biden was really bad on @GMA,\" the president tweeted on Tuesday. \"Now Sleepy Joe has real problems! Reminds me of Crooked Hillary and her 33,000 deleted Emails, not recoverable!\"\\nThe president is not the only Trump family member to target the Bidens. At a campaign rally, Eric Trump, the president\\'s son, led a chant of \"lock him up,\" referring to Hunter Biden. In response, Hunter called the Trumps \"irrelevant,\" adding that he does not spend time thinking about them.\\n\"Unlike them, I don\\'t spend a lot of time thinking about them. I really don\\'t. It\\'s all noise. And what they do is they create just an enormous amount of noise. I have to then answer questions -- about accusations made by probably the most unethical group of people that we\\'ve ever seen in this republic,\" Biden said.\\n\"They\\'ll never understand the level for how much I love my dad and how much he loves me,\" he said, adding later, \"They\\'re out of a B movie. I mean, they really are.\"\\n\"I\\'ve been through some sh-- stuff in my life. I\\'ve been through some real, real stuff. This isn\\'t real stuff. It isn\\'t. It truly isn\\'t. That part of it, that Barnum and Bailey -- you know, say anything, do anything you want, you know, I mean, like, you know, Donald Prince Humperdinck-- Trump Jr. is not somebody that I really care about,\" said Biden.\\nHunter Biden likened the president to a bully, and said, \"I don\\'t feed bullies.\" In another jab at Trump, Hunter Biden told Robach he takes \"no pleasure in this as watching this death spiral of this administration -- this president and the people that surround him.\"\\n\"It\\'s really hard for me to say anything -- snarky right now or combative because I was raised to respect that office. it\\'s making me emotional. I don\\'t -- I don\\'t know. I hope that -- that the history isn\\'t fully written yet. I hope that-- that a lot of people that -- that have a chance at redemption here stand up for what is right,\" Biden continued.\\nAnd even as he tries to remain positive, Hunter Biden worries that the undue attention on his personal life could undermine his sobriety -- an issue he has long struggled with. He was discharged from the Navy Reserve in February 2014 after a positive test for cocaine.\\n\"Like every single person that I\\'ve ever known, I have fallen and I\\'ve gotten up. I\\'ve done esteemable things and things that are -- have been in my life that I -- that -- that I regret. every single one of those things has brought me exactly to where I am right now, which is probably the best place I\\'ve ever been in my life. I\\'ve gone through my own struggles, said Biden.\\n\"You\\'ve got to live in the connections that you have to healthy things. And I have so many of them,\" he said. \"And I\\'ve got to live there instead of living I fear, like, \\'Oh my God, the stress is going to make me drink, or the stress is going to make me use.\\'\"\\nStill, as the son of the former vice president, he recognizes the reality of his position – and that if his father succeeds in winning the White House, there will be much more of the criticism.\\n\"It comes with the territory,\" he said.'], 'https://nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-has-made-twitter-his-megaphone-fact-check-won-t-n1215421': ['nbccom', \"Trump made Twitter his megaphone.

But it was two tweets about voting by mail that spurred the company to take action, adding a fact check label to them.\\nThe president fired back, tweeting that the company was \"stifling FREE SPEECH\" by fact checking his tweets about mail-in ballots.\\nBut Trump\\'s choice of Twitter as the best platform from which to attack Twitter highlights the singular appeal of the platform. As much as the president may be angry with the company, there\\'s nothing quite like the real-time global broadcasting apparatus of Twitter, as well as the network of accounts that have been built up in recent years that amplify his statements.\\nAnd Twitter has shown a willingness to let Trump test its rules — including the president\\'s most recent attacks on MSNBC host Joe Scarborough.\\n\"Twitter\\'s really the perfect platform for him,\" said Vivian Schiller, executive director of Aspen Digital, a program of the Aspen Institute.

It\\'s too late for spilled milk,\" he said. \"This issue has been completely mismanaged by both the campaign and the White House, and everyone sees he\\'s a paper tiger\" — as in someone who makes threats but doesn\\'t follow through.\\nTrump and fellow Republicans have options to exert leverage over Twitter. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said on Twitter that if the service is going to \"exercise an editorial role,\" it should lose the special protection that it and other internet companies enjoy from defamation suits. (The Communications Decency Act of 1996, often misunderstood, was written specifically so tech companies could exercise editorial judgment.)\\nDownload the NBC News app for breaking news and politics\\nTrump tweeted Wednesday morning that \"Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices,\" an indication that the president may be able to use Twitter\\'s fact checking efforts to ramp up accusations of bias against tech companies.\\n\"We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen,\" Trump added, although it\\'s unclear under what authority the government could do so.\\nIt\\'s far from the first time politicians have sought to put pressure on tech companies over efforts to rein in misinformation.\\nIn 2018, lawmakers called Dorsey in front of a congressional hearing to answer questions about how Twitter approached censorship, among other subjects. Dorsey at the time pledged to take a light touch on most subjects people tweet about.\\nIf the president wants to escalate the feud, he has few legal options, experts said.\\n\"I can\\'t think of any legit legal paths available here,\" said Chip Stewart, a professor of journalism at Texas Christian University. \"The First Amendment simply bars the government from compelling a private company\\'s speech. That would literally be the censorship Trump complains is instead happening to him.\"\\nAside from extracting further promises or making regulatory threats, the only leverage Trump has may be his presence. And he might not enjoy Facebooking, Instagramming or YouTubing as much as he does tweeting.\\nThe president has a prodigious Facebook audience, and even though the social network is much larger than Twitter and an important part of Trump\\'s re-election campaign, it doesn\\'t offer him the same instantaneous feedback of Twitter because its news feed is based on a complicated algorithm.\\nSimilarly, Instagram and Snapchat aren\\'t designed for the kind of text-heavy messages that dominate Twitter and characterize Trump\\'s announcements. YouTube requires much more camera time without the benefit of instant sharing. TikTok is also video-based and comes with rising Republican concern about its ties to China, while fringe tech startups like Gab are relatively small. Using the app Nextdoor would limit the president\\'s reach to the neighborhoods surrounding his home.\\nTwitter, likewise, has repeatedly said it doesn\\'t intend to remove Trump from the service, perhaps no matter what he says. It has also given him leeway with what he tweets.\\n\"We believe it\\'s important that the world sees how global leaders think and how they act,\" Dorsey told HuffPost last year.\\nBut now the service, by fact checking Trump for the first time, has also drawn a line in the sand — and the conflict may keep ratcheting up.\\n\"The fact that they\\'ve now applied a fact checking notice to his tweets about voting means it\\'s going to be very hard for them not to keep labeling tweets,\" said Schiller of the Aspen Institute. \"They just made life much harder for themselves, honestly.

To CNN and other establishment media outlets, this was proof that Sessions was hiding something related to Russia.\\nA little over six months later, CNN quietly walked back the scandal, explaining the FBI sent emails informing Sessions’ aide that he did not need to disclose the meetings on his forms because they were carried out in the course of his duties as a senator.\\n6. Russians Aren’t Just Hacking The Election — They’re Hacking Our Power Grid\\nThe Washington Post claimed in January 2017 that Russians were hacking the U.S. power grid through a company in Vermont, only to change the story to say that only one laptop was infiltrated. It turns out that one laptop was never even connected to the power grid.\\n7. Republicans Funded The Dossier!\\nA number of news outlets have consistently claimed that Republicans initially paid for the anti-Trump Steele dossier, failing to note that Steele wasn’t even contracted by Fusion GPS until after the GOP donors pulled funding. The Republican donors say they paid Fusion for standard opposition research and that they have zero connection to the dossier.\\nThe media has perpetuated this falsehood so consistently that even former FBI director James Comey was confused, repeating the lie in an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier.\\n8. CNN Gets Comey Prediction Wildly Wrong\\nPrior to former FBI director James Comey’s congressional testimony last June, CNN asserted that Comey was prepared to contradict a key claim by President Trump — that Comey told him he was not under investigation.\\nSadly for them, Comey’s prepared testimony was released with the line, “During our one-on-one meeting at Trump Tower … I offered that assurance [that he was not under investigation].”\\n9. The ’17 Intel Agencies’ Lie\\nThe media perpetuated a false claim from presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for months, insisting that all 17 intelligence agencies agree that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. The New York Times, for example, rated that claim as true only to later say the exact opposite.\\nOnly four intelligence agencies ultimately deemed Russia responsible for meddling because the other 13 have no business making judgments on the claim. As The NYT succinctly explained, “The rest were doing other work.”\\n10. Manafort Notes Are A Nothing Burger\\nNBC botched its big scoop claiming that Paul Manafort’s notes from a meeting with a Russian lawyer included the word “donations” near a reference to the Republican National Committee.\\nTurns out, not only did the word “donations” not appear in Manafort’s notes, but the word “donor” didn’t, either. POLITICO had to correct the NBC report, leaving the legacy network looking awfully embarrassed.\\n11. NBC Issues Cohen Correction\\nNBC issued a major correction in May on a story about wiretaps and Michael Cohen.\\nNBC initially claimed that federal investigators were listening in on Cohen’s phone calls, but it turns out they had what’s called a “pen register warrant,” which means they could see who Cohen spoke to on the phone but could not hear what was said.(RELATED: MSNBC Issues HUGE Correction To Michael Cohen ‘Wiretap’ Story)\\n12. Did Cohen Go To Prague?\\nA McClatchy report stated that special counsel Robert Mueller had evidence that Michael Cohen visited Prague in the summer of 2016, which seemed to corroborate the portion of the Steele dossier claiming Cohen visited Prague at that time to meet with a Kremlin official.\\nHowever, no other outlets ever confirmed the report and Cohen told Congress during an open hearing in February that he has never been to Prague. (RELATED: Here’s Why You Should Be Skeptical Of That Michael Cohen Prague Story)\\n13. Busted BuzzFeed\\nThe special counsel’s office disputed a 2019 report by BuzzFeed claiming that Trump directed his lawyer to lie about a potential business deal in Moscow during the 2016 presidential campaign.\\nThe BuzzFeed report was used to float impeachment proceedings and obstruction of justice charges against the president, but Mueller’s team disputed the core premise of the reporting.\\n“BuzzFeed’s description of specific statements to the Special Counsel’s Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen’s Congressional testimony are not accurate,” spokesman Peter Carr said in a statement to The Daily Caller News Foundation.\\n14. Lanny Davis Obliterates CNN’s Trump Tower Story\\nCNN reported in July that former Trump attorney Michael Cohen was prepared to tell special counsel Robert Mueller that the president had knowledge in advance of a Trump Tower meeting between his son and Russians.\\nBut Cohen’s lawyer, Lanny Davis, said in August that CNN’s reporting got “mixed up” and that Cohen had no information related to the Trump Tower meeting. Cohen said the same to Congress on two separate occasions.\\nCNN doubled, tripled, and quadrupled down on its reporting, despite a series of issues with the report.\\n15. NPR Accuses Don Jr. Of Perjury\\nNPR published a report in November insisting that Donald Trump Jr. lied to Congress about efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow because his statements conflicted with those of former Trump attorney Michael Cohen.\\nHowever, NPR failed to realize that the piece of Trump Jr.’s testimony they quoted was about a different project.\\n“Trump Jr.’s statements about work on a Trump Tower Moscow that ended in 2014 referred to negotiations with Aras Agalarov,” The Daily Caller News Foundation’s Chuck Ross explained. “Felix Sater, a businessman with links to Cohen and Russian officials, tried to make a Trump Tower Moscow happen in 2015.”\\n16. Mic Claims Russian Spy Infiltrated The Oval\\nShortly after it was revealed that a Russian spy was attempting to infiltrate right-wing networks, Mic writer Emily Singer claimed that same Russian spy was present during an Oval Office meeting with Russian diplomat Sergey Lavrov.\\nSinger claimed Russian spy Maria Butina was spotted in a photo of the meeting, citing the fact that she has red hair like the woman in the photo.\\nThe woman in the photo is actually NSC staffer Cari Lutkins.\\nThis story was originally published in May 2018 but has been updated with additional information regarding the delivery of Mueller’s report to Attorney General Bill Barr.\\nFollow Amber on Twitter'], 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/game-on-after-trump-declares-peace-talks-dead-us-commander-takes-aim-at-taliban': ['washingtonexaminer.com', 'Game on: After Trump declares peace talks ‘dead,’ US commander takes aim at Taliban', '', datetime.datetime(2019, 9, 10, 11, 40, 19), 'GAME ON: Angered by the Taliban’s deadly attacks on civilians and United States troops, President Trump declared negotiations over an American withdrawal from Afghanistan “dead” and promised to make the Taliban regret its “mistake.”\\n“You can\\'t do that with me. So they\\'re dead, as far as I\\'m concerned. And we\\'ve hit the Taliban harder in the last four days than they\\'ve been hit in over 10 years,” Trump told reporters at the White House.\\nOn a visit to Afghanistan, the U.S. Central Command chief, Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, brushed off Taliban threats that “Americans will suffer more than anyone else for canceling the talks.”\\n“We’re certainly not going to sit still and let them carry out some self-described race to victory. That’s not going to happen,” McKenzie told a group of reporters traveling with him, according to Reuters . “Whatever targets are available, whatever targets can be lawfully and ethically struck, I think we’re going to pursue those targets.”\\nMORE AIRSTRIKES?: McKenzie seemed to be hinting that the U.S.-led coalition and Afghanistan’s fledgling air force would be stepping up attacks against Taliban targets.\\nWhile a Sept. 3 United Nations report said strikes in Afghanistan were up 57% over last year for the period between May 10 and Aug. 8, numbers posted by U.S. Air Forces Central Command show the number of actual munitions dropped by 5.7%.\\nOn Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed the U.S. had killed 1,000 Taliban fighters over the previous 10 days. The Pentagon yesterday did not confirm that number.\\nAsked yesterday about the way ahead, Trump didn’t have a clear answer. “We beat them militarily, but as soon as we leave, it seems to form again. We would beat them very easily militarily if we wanted to by doing certain things, and I\\'m not talking nuclear,” he said “We could have that over with very, very rapidly, but you\\'d lose millions and millions of lives, and I don\\'t want to do that.”\\nTRUMP TOOK HIS OWN ADVICE: Whose idea was it to invite the Taliban to Camp David the week of the 18th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks?\\n“I took my own advice. I like the idea of meeting. I\\'ve met with a lot of bad people and a lot of good people during the course of the last almost three years,” Trump said yesterday. “It was my idea, and it was my idea to terminate it. I didn\\'t discuss it with anybody else.”\\nTrump stopped short of ruling out a future agreement. “We\\'re talking to the government, we\\'re talking to a lot of different people, and we\\'ll see.” he said. “But I canceled Camp David on the basis that they did something that they sure as hell shouldn\\'t have done.”\\nWITHERING CRITICISM: Even after it was rescinded, the invitation to the Taliban outraged many members of Congress, including some in Trump\\'s own party. “Camp David is where America’s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11,” tweeted Wisconsin Republican Rep. Liz Cheney over the weekend. “No member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever.“\\nBut yesterday on Fox News Channel, she softened her criticism. “I think that the important thing is to look at what actually transpired. And what has transpired now is the president has done exactly the right thing,” Cheney told Bret Baier. “This president has shown that he is willing consistently to walk away from bad deals.”\\nBut Cheney also said negotiating with the Taliban is a mistake. “We shouldn\\'t be. And that\\'s why I am very glad that the president said these talks are dead, we\\'re not going to be negotiating with them. You can\\'t trust the Taliban.”\\n“You know, we\\'ve been talking to the Taliban for years. But the notion that somehow we think they\\'re going to be a partner for peace, that somehow they\\'re going to give us counterterrorism assurances that we can count on — well, it\\'s wrong.“\\nA WAY FORWARD?: Meanwhile, four former national security professionals, including two retired generals, have penned an open letter to Trump advocating a new approach for securing Afghanistan, which they say is based on a “special operations model” and would dramatically lower the U.S. footprint in the country.\\nThe concept would rely on “relatively small units of highly skilled professionals backed by reliable airpower, sophisticated intelligence capabilities and logistic supply,” according to the letter signed by retired Lt. Gen. William “Jerry” Boykin, Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney, former acting assistant defense secretary Frank Gaffney, and a former leader of a Vietnam-era counterinsurgency program, Stephen Young.\\n“This would reduce the existing 15,000 U.S. forces currently in country to approximately 2,000 and the number of contractors there from 37,000 to roughly 6,000. Associated costs would be reduced from $62-plus billion per year to under $10 billion per year,” they say.\\nGood Tuesday morning and welcome to Jamie McIntyre’s Daily on Defense, written and compiled by Washington Examiner National Security Senior Writer Jamie McIntyre ( @jamiejmcintyre ) and edited by Kelly Jane Torrance ( @kjtorrance ).

That depends, of course, on the outcome of a scheduled Senate vote set for 10 a.m.\\nThe post has been vacant for almost a year, since Nikki Haley announced she was stepping down last October and exited Dec. 31.\\nALSO TODAY: The Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee will be marking up the appropriations bill for the Defense Department amid fears that the final measure won’t be approved in time for the Pentagon to get its money by the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year.\\n“DoD\\'s senior leaders will be meeting with members of Congress throughout the month to discuss the importance of passing a budget no later than Oct. 1,” chief Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said yesterday. “Passing a budget on time is crucial to the department\\'s ability to implement the National Defense Strategy.”\\nYesterday on the Senate floor, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated that three weeks may not be enough time to get all 12 spending measures passed. “I\\'m confident we can make significant progress on regular appropriations this month and then pass an interim continuing resolution to prevent any funding lapse while that work continues,\" he said.\\nABOUT THOSE STAYS AT TRUMP’S PLACE: House Democrats are gearing up to try to block the use of Pentagon funds for military personnel to stay at any properties owned by President Trump.\\nYesterday, the Pentagon offered a spirited defense of a recent trip in which Air Force personnel overnighted at the president\\'s Turnberry resort in Scotland. “As our aircrews serve on these international airlift missions, they follow strict guidelines on contracting for hotel accommodations and all expenditures of taxpayer dollars,” said Hoffman in a briefing for reporters. “In this case, they made reservations through the Defense Travel System and used the closest available and least expensive accommodation to the airfield within the crew\\'s allowable hotel rates.”\\n\"The President has already shown a willingness to violate the Constitution\\'s Emoluments Clause, and Congress has a duty to use every tool we can to stop him,” said Virginia Rep. Don Beyer in a statement to Politico. “The House sent a clear message by adopting our amendment in July that we will not allow taxpayer funds, including the defense budget, to be used to enrich the President.”\\nNOTHING TO DO WITH ME: “I know nothing about an Air Force plane landing at an airport (which I do not own and have nothing to do with) near Turnberry Resort (which I do own) in Scotland, and filling up with fuel, with the crew staying overnight at Turnberry (they have good taste!),” Trump tweeted yesterday. “NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.”\\nLater speaking to reporters, he said, “I\\'m going to be giving out a financial report of me and it\\'ll be extremely complete. … And you\\'ll be extremely shocked that the numbers are many, many times what you think. I don\\'t need to have somebody take a room overnight at a hotel.”\\nTHERE’S ALSO THE AIRPORT: The New York Times, citing government records released through Scottish freedom of information law, reports that the Trump Organization, starting in 2014, entered into a partnership with Glasgow Prestwick Airport to try to increase private and commercial air traffic to the region.\\n“As part of that arrangement, the Trump Organization worked to get Trump Turnberry added to a list of hotels that the airport would routinely send aircrews to, even though the Turnberry resort is 20 miles from the airport, farther away than many other hotels, and has higher advertised prices.”\\nMIXED MESSAGE: North Korea launched two more “projectiles” into the sea today, at the same time it made noises about restarting nuclear talks with the U.S.\\nThe test — believed to involve short-range missiles — is North Korea’s eighth since late July, all of which have been dismissed by Trump as insignificant.\\nThe latest launches came just hours after the North\\'s First Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui expressed a willingness to resume denuclearization talks with the United States in late September but warned North Korea needed to see some new U.S. proposals.\\n“It just came out over the wires that he\\'d like to have a meeting. I have a very good relationship with Chairman Kim, Kim Jong Un, and it just came out,” Trump said in reaction to Choe’s statement.\\n“I just saw it as I\\'m coming out here — just came out that they would like to meet. We\\'ll see what happens,” Trump said. “But I always say having meetings is a good thing, not a bad thing.”\\nPENTAGON’S 9/11 MEMORIAL TO CLOSE FOR REPAIRS: The Pentagon will hold its annual Sept. 11 observance tomorrow at the National 9/11 Pentagon Memorial but will then close the site for repairs a few days later until next May.\\n“This project will address re-occurring failures of the lighting systems in the pools under the memorial benches from water seeping into the fixtures,” a Pentagon statement said. “This project will also replace the entire electrical system at the Pentagon Memorial, including all of the bench lighting, as well as the entire electrical conduit that feeds power to the light fixtures.”\\nREP. SUSAN DAVIS RETIRES: California Democrat Susan Davis, one of the House Armed Services Committee’s most senior members, has announced she will retire at the end of the 116th Congress following nearly two decades of service.\\n“During her tenure as Chairwoman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, she advocated for issues that have had an undeniable, lasting impact on all service members,” said committee chairman Adam Smith in a statement.\\nThe Rundown\\nWashington Examiner: Three DHS secretaries disagree with Trump: Mexico border not a top security threat\\nAP: Trump’s Afghanistan decision pushes country toward vote\\nNew York Times: Weary of War, but More Wary of the Taliban\\nAP: Analysis: North Korean tests put pressure on Washington\\nBloomberg: Iran\\'s Dark Tanker Fleet Poses the Oil World\\'s Biggest Mystery\\nNew York Times: Israel’s Leader Says Iran Hid a Nuclear Weapons Site\\nMilitary.com: Marco Rubio Says Navy Ships Should Be Sent to the Bahamas \\'As Soon As Possible\\'\\nStars and Stripes: Pentagon Says 1,200 Troops Have Been Mobilized to Assist Dorian-Ravaged Bahamas\\nUSNI News: Navy Claims A Strong Technical Foundation Ahead Of Testing New Classes Of Unmanned Ships\\nWall Street Journal: Professor Linked to Huawei Is Charged\\nTalk Media News: Longtime allies France and US weave in and out linguistically on critical challenges\\nWashington Post: Naval Academy opens investigation into reports of a noose\\nWashington Examiner: Holes poked in CNN report blaming Trump for alarm that led to extraction of Kremlin informant\\nWashington Post: In the Army’s new museum, the soldiers look alive and the battle scenes are all too real\\nCalendar\\nTUESDAY I SEPTEMBER 10\\n9:30 a.m. 300 First Street S.E.

Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\\nUpdated at 9:15 p.m. ET\\nAs President Trump\\'s legal team pressed the case for acquittal on Monday, they repeatedly made two points: the charges against Trump do not meet the constitution\\'s criteria for impeachment. And if the president is removed from office for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, it will set a \"dangerous\" precedent.\\n\"You cannot turn conduct that is not impeachable into impeachable conduct simply by using words like quid pro quo,\" said one of Trump\\'s lawyers, Alan Dershowitz, calling the charges \"vague, indefinable.\"\\nSaid Dershowitz on the impeachment charges sent to the Senate by House Democrats: \"This is a realistic threat to all future presidents.\"\\nTrump\\'s lawyers maintain that the president was legally justified in freezing military assistance to Ukraine and that the case against Trump presented by Democrats in the Senate last week does not constitute a crime and thus cannot trigger removal from office, a notion that has received strenuous skepticism from legal scholars.\\nMost impeachment trial watchers on Monday, however, were following a major development that occurred outside of the Senate chamber.\\nA report in The New York Times about the alleged conversation between Trump and former National Security Adviser John Bolton — contained in a draft of the former national security adviser\\'s book manuscript — shifted the focus to whether senators would vote to call witnesses, including Bolton, as part of the proceedings.\\nThe report was based on Bolton\\'s forthcoming book, a draft of which had been sent to the White House as part of a standard review process.\\nAs speculation grew about whether Republicans would support calling Bolton, Dershowitz referenced the former top Trump official and dismissed the portions of his yet-to-be-published book that have grabbed the headlines.\\n\"Nothing in the Bolton revelations, even if true, would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an impeachable offense,\" he said.\\nTwo Republican senators, Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine, said Monday that the revelations about Bolton\\'s book have made it more likely that senators will want to call Bolton to testify.\\n\"I think it\\'s increasingly likely that other Republicans will join those of us who think we should hear from John Bolton,\" Romney said, noting that he would make his final decision on the issue after hearing from Trump\\'s defense.\\nCollins tweeted that the reports about Bolton\\'s book \"strengthen the case for witnesses and have prompted a number of conversations among my colleagues.\"\\nTwo others who are seen as more open to calling witnesses — Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee — were tight-lipped.\\nAlexander said senators will decide \"to call witnesses or other documents if we needed them after we hear all the arguments.\" Murkowski said in a tweet that while she was \"curious\" about what Bolton had to say, there is \"an appropriate time for us to evaluate whether we need additional information.\"\\nJay Sekulow, Trump\\'s personal attorney, argued that the president \"was at all times\" acting under his constitutional and legal authority by withholding aid to Ukraine, saying that Trump\\'s impeachment is about \"deep policy concerns.\"\\nKen Starr, the former independent counsel who led the impeachment efforts against President Bill Clinton in 1998 and is now part of Trump\\'s defense team, began his arguments by reciting a history of impeachment and declared, \"Like war, impeachment is hell.\" He said, \"It divides the country like nothing else. Those of us who lived through the Clinton impeachment understand that in a deep and personal way. \"\\nStarr went on to accuse the House of abusing its power by approving article 2, which charges that Trump obstructed Congress.\\n\"Here, we have, tragically for the country and, I believe, tragically for the House of Representatives, in article 2 of these impeachment articles, a runaway House,\" Starr said. \"It has run away not only from its long-standing procedures — it has run away from the Constitution\\'s demand of fundamental fairness.\"\\nAnother of Trump\\'s attorneys, Jane Raskin, spoke to defend Rudy Giuliani, Trump lawyer who was painted by the House managers as leading a rogue foreign policy operation by pursuing information against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, as well as pressuring to remove former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.\\nGiuliani, said Raskin, was the House\\'s \"colorful distraction,\" and, \"a shiny object designed to distract you.\"\\nShe said the \"House managers may not like his style, you may not like his style. But one might argue, that he is everything that Clarence Darrow said a defense lawyer must be, outrageous, irreverent, blasphemous, a rogue, a renegade.\"\\nLater in the afternoon, Trump attorney Pam Bondi, a former Florida attorney general, rose to attack former Vice President Biden and his son Hunter\\'s dealings in Ukraine. The younger Biden was hired to sit on the board of a Ukrainian gas company Burisma at the same time his father was the Obama administration\\'s point man in fighting corruption there. In the infamous July 25th phone call, Trump asked Ukraine\\'s president to \"do us a favor, though\" and investigate the Bidens. The first article of impeachment charges Trump with abusing the power of his office by asking for the investigation in return for releasing nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. Trump denies any such link was made, though Bolton\\'s book appears to undercut that assertion.\\nBondi said the younger Biden was paid $83,000 a month to sit on the Burisma board, and played a news clip in which Hunter was asked if would have been hired by the firm if his last name wasn\\'t Biden. \"I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know, he responded. Probably not.\"\\nThe push for witnesses\\nOver three days of arguments last week, House impeachment managers outlined their case that Trump enlisted a foreign power to help him cheat in the 2020 election and then has tried to cover it up. They\\'ve said that the president\\'s conduct is the \"worst nightmare\" of the nation\\'s Framers.\\nTrump\\'s legal team is facing a mostly sympathetic group of jurors in the Republican-controlled Senate. An acquittal on the two articles of impeachment is all but guaranteed, since the Democratic caucus would need 20 GOP members\\' support to have the two-thirds majority needed to convict and remove the president.\\nMore up in the air, however, is whether Democrats will be able to recruit enough Republicans to call witnesses for the trial. That vote has a lower threshold than the one required to remove the president from office. At least four GOP senators would have to cross party lines to call witnesses or subpoena documents.\\nIn light of the Times\\' report on Sunday, Democrats were quick to reiterate that Bolton should testify.\\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Monday that the revelations should remove the GOP resistance against witnesses. He said details in the book provide \"further evidence that a large number of people were in the loop\" on Trump\\'s alleged pressure campaign on Ukraine.\\nSchumer said there seems to be a \"giant cover-up\" within the White House and added that if Republicans don\\'t vote to call witnesses, including Bolton, \"they are going to be part of the cover-up too.\"\\nSen. Angus King, I-Maine, told NPR on Monday that up to 10 Republican senators could vote for witnesses following the Times\\' report about the Bolton manuscript.\\n\"I\\'m already hearing a number of Republicans who are moving toward voting to at least hear from John Bolton, if not other witnesses,\" he said. When asked if four Republicans would vote for witnesses, he said: \"I think there\\'ll be more. My bold prediction will be five or 10.\"\\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the lead impeachment manager, linked testimony from Bolton to the very notion of a fair trial. \"To say we will blind ourselves from a witness who has so clearly relevant testimony to one of the central most serious allegations against the president — I don\\'t see how we can have a fair trial without testimony like that,\" he told reporters on Monday before the White House lawyers continued their arguments.\\nHouse Democrats had asked Bolton to testify during the impeachment inquiry but did not issue him a subpoena. The White House had ordered senior officials to not testify.\\nAny vote on witnesses and new evidence would come after the defense team rests (it has up to 24 hours over three days) and after senators have a chance to ask questions in writing of both House prosecutors and Trump\\'s legal team. The questions will be read out loud by Chief Justice John Roberts, who\\'s presiding over the trial.\\nBolton\\'s manuscript\\nNPR has not seen a draft of the manuscript and cannot vouch for the accuracy of the report on Trump\\'s comments to the former national security adviser. A spokesman for the National Security Council said no one at the White House other than people at the NSC had reviewed Bolton\\'s book.\\n\"Ambassador Bolton\\'s manuscript was submitted to the NSC for pre-publication review and has been under initial review by the NSC,\" NSC spokesman John Ullyot said in a statement. \"No White House personnel outside NSC have reviewed the manuscript.\"\\nTrump denied Bolton\\'s account in a series of tweets.\\n\"I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens,\" he said. \"If John Bolton said this,\" Trump continued, \"it was only to sell a book.\"\\nThe military assistance and the desired investigations are at the heart of the impeachment proceedings. Democrats say Trump\\'s actions constitute a clear case of abuse of power, with Trump placing his personal interests over the country\\'s. The legal team representing Trump in the Senate trial argues that the president had justifiable concern about corruption in Ukraine.\\nThe aid was ultimately released without the inquiries.\\nThe constitutional standard\\nLawyers for the president offered a brief glimpse of their defense Saturday, minimizing the evidence that House investigators gathered before the Democratic-led chamber impeached Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\\nPat Cipollone, the White House counsel, claimed Democrats\\' push to remove Trump from office is aimed at overturning the result of the 2016 election and \"tearing up [voters\\'] ballots\" months before the 2020 election.\\nOn Sunday, Alan Dershowitz, another member of the defense team, said on Fox News Sunday that the Democratic-led prosecution does not have a case that passes constitutional muster.\\n\"They completely failed to meet that high constitutional standard, and therefore it would be unconstitutional to remove a president based on the allegations that were made against him,\" Dershowitz said. \"They imposed very stringent criteria for impeachment that haven\\'t been met in this case,\" citing the Founders\\' standard for impeachment, which is \"treason, bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\\nIn December, the House passed two articles of impeachment against Trump: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The vote for impeachment followed hours of testimony, in private and in public, with more than a dozen witnesses during the House impeachment inquiry.\\nTrump\\'s legal team is also expected to take aim at the president\\'s potential political opponent, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden, making the case that Trump had good reason to want Ukrainian investigators to launch criminal probes into the activities of the Bidens in Ukraine. (While Joe Biden was vice president, Hunter Biden took a position as board member of a gas company in Ukraine.)\\nThe full-throated defense of Trump comes after the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office declared that the president broke the law in ordering a hold on nearly $400 million in security assistance to Ukraine.\\nBecause the Trump administration refused to participate in the House impeachment inquiry, the president\\'s defense in the Senate is the first time Trump\\'s team is presenting a lengthy rebuttal to the charges against him.\\nLoading...\\nNPR\\'s Roberta Rampton and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this story.'], 'https://www.foxnews.com/media/furor-over-trump-pardons-as-frustrated-barr-weighs-quitting': ['foxcom', 'Furor over Trump pardons as frustrated Barr weighs quitting', 'Howard Kurtz', datetime.datetime(2020, 2, 20, 3, 7, 1), \"Donald Trump and his attorney general seem headed for a confrontation, just as the president is declaring himself the nation’s “chief law enforcement officer” and handing out controversial pardons.\\nAs the Washington Post reported, and others have confirmed, William Barr “has told people close to President Trump — both inside and outside the White House — that he is considering quitting over Trump’s tweets about Justice Department investigations”—that's according to three administration officials.\\nBLOOMBERG PLAYS DEFENSE AS THE MEDIA TRUMPET OPPO RESEARCH\\nWhether the leak suggests that Barr is reaching his breaking point or is just pushing back against his boss, the press is playing this as a high-noon showdown. After the AG said Trump’s constant tweets about Justice Department cases was making it “impossible” for him to do his job, the president tweeted again, pushing for a new trial for his convicted pal Roger Stone. (Barr’s department argued the opposite in court.)\\nWhile Barr’s spokeswoman says he has “no plans” to quit, that was a weak denial--you don’t have plans until you do it—that didn’t address what he’s been telling people. Trump told reporters he does indeed make Barr’s job harder, but he needs to use social media because it gives him a “voice” that the press denies him. (The press gives him plenty of voice, of course, but it’s not unfiltered.)\\nSources told the Post that “Trump considers highlighting what he sees as misconduct at the FBI and Justice Department as a good political message.” This dovetails with my theory that his overriding goal is to appear strong—whether it’s against DOJ or the Dems, intel agencies or Iran—and let others debate the fine print.\\nIf you take a step back, the president has been beating up on a whole bunch of people whose job is to enforce the law (Mueller, Comey, McCabe, Sessions, Judge Amy Berman Jackson) and defending a number of folks who have been convicted of crimes (Stone, Mike Flynn, Paul Manafort). And that list grew longer with the latest pardons and commutations.\\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\\nThe New York Times called it a day when “the president asserted his dominance over a justice system that had long sought to insulate itself from political pressures.”\\nRod Blagojevich, the former Democratic governor of Illinois who now calls himself a “Trump-o-crat,” is getting the most attention. The impeached ex-governor walked out of prison yesterday after the president commuted his 14-year sentence, with eight years served. Blago was once a contestant on “Celebrity Apprentice,” and Trump saw his wife pleading his case on Fox.\\nBlagojevich famously tried to sell Barack Obama’s Senate seat after the 2008 election. “I’ve got this thing and it’s f***ing golden,” he declared in a wiretapped conversation. He wouldn’t give it away for “nothing.” Is there anything that strikes more at the heart of our system than that?\\nThe president, criticized by some Illinois Republicans, tweeted that Blago “did not sell the Senate seat.” Yeah, because he got caught.\\nBy the way, Blagojevich was also convicted of such offenses as shaking down the head of a children’s hospital for a $50,000 contribution in exchange for millions in funding for pediatric doctors to treat sick kids.\\nTrump also pardoned Michael Milken, the onetime junk bond king—I covered his indictment, brought by Rudy Giuliani—who did tremendous damage to the banking system. But he has turned into a major philanthropist, especially in cancer research. And he pardoned former New York police commissioner Bernie Kerik, a Giuliani associate, who was convicted of tax fraud and lying to White House officials.\\nIt’s certainly fair game to criticize Trump for going outside the DOJ system and relying on friends and allies of those convicted. But the tone is out of proportion considering that other presidents have used (or abused) that constitutional power.\\nBill Clinton pardoned his half-brother Roger, as well as Marc Rich, a financier who, outrageously, had fled the country.\\nGeorge H.W.

Michael Waltz of Florida and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois come one day after Trump tweeted that he invited Taliban leaders to Camp David for secret peace talks this weekend but canceled the meeting after the Taliban took credit for an attack in Kabul that killed a dozen people, including an American soldier. Trump has long sought to withdraw the US from its longest war, but his revelation on Saturday night that he was considering holding talks with the Taliban at Camp David – a storied retreat where presidents have famously secured peace accords – was striking, especially coming so close to the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.\\n“As we head into the anniversary of 9/11, I do not ever want to see these terrorists step foot on United States soil. Period,” Waltz, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield on “Newsroom” Sunday afternoon.\\nWaltz said Sunday that among his top concerns over Trump’s invitation was the Taliban “declaring this a victory.”\\n“The Taliban have shown zero desire for peace. There’s no ceasefire that they’ve agreed to. In fact, they’ve ramped up their attacks. We talked about the American soldier that just came home this morning in a coffin,” he said.\\n“So I just have a lot of concerns. I’m urging the President to walk away from this deal as it stands,” he added.\\nKinzinger, an Air Force veteran who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan, told CNN’s Ana Cabrera later Sunday that he was in “disbelief” that “Taliban leaders, in the week of 9/11 … were going to come to really the area in the United States, not too far from New York, Camp David, that has been a place of such wonderful things that have happened in the past.”\\nHe added that “negotiations between nation states can happen there, but a terrorist organization that doesn’t recognize nation states, that kills innocent women and children, that denies women the right to really even be in the same room as their husbands … to have them at Camp David is totally unacceptable.”\\nKinzinger said Trump was correct to walk away from the talks.\\nWhen pressed by CNN’s Jake Tapper earlier Sunday over criticism of the invitation to host Taliban leaders just days from the 9/11 anniversary, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo only offered that the US has “made real progress” toward peace talks.\\n“It’s not just about commitments. We have to see them be able to deliver it. We have to have proof that it’s delivered. When we get to that point, when American national security interests can be protected I am confident President Trump will continue the process of trying to get what he has talked about since his campaign – a reduction of our risk level and the cost to the American people both in terms of life and treasure there in Afghanistan.”\\nPompeo added that the US is still interested in striking a peace deal with the Taliban but won’t move forward until there is proof that the Taliban can deliver on its commitments under a potential agreement.\\nThis story has been updated.'], 'http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2016/0824/Trump-Clinton-Obama-How-do-their-immigration-plans-stack-up': ['csmonitor.com', 'Trump, Clinton, Obama: How do their immigration plans stack up?', 'The Christian Science Monitor, Josh Lederman', datetime.datetime(2016, 8, 24, 9, 53, 50), 'Donald Trump\\'s new line on immigration – \"fair, but firm\" – is leaving both Republicans and Democrats with the same question: Is the famously hard-line GOP nominee softening his approach?\\nHis campaign insists his position is \"exactly the same\" in principle. But even Trump acknowledged Tuesday there \"could certainly be a softening, because we\\'re not looking to hurt people.\"\\nAnd in the course of just a few days, Trump has gone from calling for mass deportations for millions – a position to the right of even many Republicans – to arguing deportations should focus on those who commit crimes, veering into the same territory as President Barack Obama and Democrat Hillary Clinton.\\nSo what gives?\\nIf this week\\'s string of vague and contradictory statements by Trump and his team is revealing anything, it\\'s that his immigration policy is still evolving. Just days ago Trump reshuffled his campaign staff as part of an effort to recalibrate his message for the general election, in which his tough stance on immigration may be more of a liability than it was in the Republican primary.\\nThis week, Trump\\'s campaign postponed a major immigration speech scheduled for this week, but announced he\\'d hold two events highlighting border security needs and crimes committed by immigrants in the U.S. illegally.\\nA look at what Trump has proposed, compared to Clinton\\'s policies and Obama\\'s record in office:\\nDeportations\\nTrump: From the start, the brash billionaire\\'s campaign has been rooted in the promise of a dramatically different approach to immigration. He presented a detailed deportation plan for 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally, complete with estimated timeframes and references to a \"deportation force.\" Trump argued all would have to return to their country of origin but that the \"good people\" could come back through legal processes.\\nHis tune seems to have changed. On Monday, Trump said his first focus would be to get rid of \"the bad ones.\" Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Trump wanted to deport immigrants with criminal records, not all 11 million. What about that deportation force? \"He has not said that for a while,\" Conway said.\\nClinton: The Democratic nominee has said overhauling immigration laws will be a top priority, but in the meantime, she says current laws should be enforced \"humanely.\" Her campaign says deportations would focus on immigrants \"who pose a violent threat to public safety.\" Clinton wants to shut down privately run detention centers.\\nObama: Immigration advocates have railed against Obama for deporting huge numbers – more than 2.5 million in all – and dubbed him the \"deporter in chief.\" In 2012, Immigration and Customs Enforcement set a record of removing 409,000 immigrants. Since then, though, the numbers have declined to just 235,413 in the 2016 budget year.\\nChildren and families\\nTrump: He\\'s offered conflicting takes on how he\\'d deal with immigrants brought here illegally as children, and their parents. He praised the Supreme Court\\'s move in June that halted Obama\\'s second wave of executive actions on that issue, actions Trump decried as \"executive amnesty.\" His campaign says he\\'d reverse Obama\\'s remaining actions.\\nOn the other hand, Trump has said he wouldn\\'t split up families, though he hasn\\'t explained how he\\'d reconcile those policies. He also supports eliminating birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to parents who came here illegally.\\nClinton: She wants to preserve Obama\\'s executive actions – both those affecting children and those affecting their parents. Clinton also wants to expand those actions to immigrants who have contributed to their communities or faced \"extreme labor violations.\"\\nObama: Obama\\'s position, like Trump\\'s recent comments, is rooted in the notion that limited law enforcement resources should be focused on law-breaking immigrants, not kids and families.\\nThe president\\'s first set of executive actions has shielded more than 800,000 young immigrants from deportation since 2012. After Republicans won the Senate in 2014 and the prospect of an immigration overhaul grew dimmer, Obama acted again to protect up to 4 million parents of U.S. citizens or permanent residents and let them work legally. The courts have put the more recent actions on hold.\\nBorder security\\nTrump: He says the border isn\\'t adequately protected. Trump has called for tripling the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, who handle deportations.\\nAnd then, of course, there\\'s the wall. Trump is standing firm behind his plans to build a \"real wall\" on the Mexican border and to force Mexico to fund it. He says until Mexico pays up, the U.S. will increase visa and border crossing fees, \"impound all remittance payments\" from immigrants here illegally, and possibly increase tariffs or cut foreign aid.\\nClinton: She\\'s called for securing U.S. borders, but has also said the U.S. is already doing \"a really good job.\" In March, Clinton said increased border security staffing, new fencing and lower immigration rates have lessened the problem.\\nShe opposes Trump\\'s wall.\\nObama: In the 2008 budget year, before Obama took office, the U.S. had about 17,000 Border Patrol agents, reflecting an increase under President George W. Bush from the 9,212 the U.S. had in 2000. Obama increased it to 20,199 in 2009, and the numbers have hovered around there ever since. Border apprehensions dropped significantly during that time.\\nGet stories that\\nempower and uplift daily. By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy Already a subscriber?

Senators voted 52-48 to acquit him on charges that he abused power, and 53-47 to acquit him on obstruction of Congress charges.\\nThe reality, though, is that the only reason a majority of the Senate voted to keep Trump in office is that the body is configured in a way that systemically advantages Republicans. The blue state of California has 68 times as many people as the red state of Wyoming, for example, but both states still receive two senators.\\nDemocrats actually control a majority of the Senate seats (26-24) representing the most populous half of the states. Republicans owe their majority in the Senate as a whole to their 29-21 lead in the least populous half of the states. This means that overall, the current Republican Senate “majority” represents about 15 million fewer people than the Democratic “minority.”\\nOn the first article of impeachment, abuse of power, Republican Sen. Mitt Romney joined every member of the Democratic caucus to vote to remove President Trump from office. That means that the senators voting to convict represent about 170 million individuals — 18 million more people than the bloc of senators who voted to acquit.\\nI derived these numbers using a fairly simple method. Using 2016 US Census data for each state’s population, I created a two-column spreadsheet, with columns labeled “acquit” and “convict.” In each state where both senators voted to acquit, I allocated the full population of the state to the “acquit” column. I also allocated the full population of the state to the “convict” column in states where both senators voted to convict.\\nIn states where the two senators split their vote, I allocated half the state’s population to one column and half to the other. All told, the senators voting to acquit represent about 152 million individuals, while senators voting to convict represent about 170 million individuals.\\nYou can check my work here.\\nAs a practical matter, Trump likely would remain in office even if the Senate were not malapportioned. The Constitution provides that, in an impeachment trial, “no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present.” In a Senate fairly apportioned by population, Democrats would have a majority, but they almost certainly would not have a large enough majority to remove a president.\\nNevertheless, the fact remains that senators representing about 53 percent of the nation voted to remove Trump from office.

In a move that surprised lawyers everywhere, Rittenhouse took the stand in his own defense. That is unusual in criminal cases, and it\\'s especially unusual in murder trials. And the reason is simple: the stakes are too high. One wrong answer in a cross-examination, and you could wind up spending life in prison.\\nBut this case was different. By the time he testified today, Kyle Rittenhouse had already won the case. At this point, there was no remaining doubt that Kyle Rittenhouse acted in self-defense during the riots last summer in Kenosha. Every shot Rittenhouse fired was captured on videotape, and from multiple angles. Every single witness who testified this week at the trial confirmed exactly what happened.\\nAnd here are the facts of it.\\nKYLE RITTENHOUSE TAKES THE STAND IN HIS OWN DEFENSE\\nA convicted child rapist called Joseph Rosenbaum was released from a mental hospital, then went directly to join the mob that was burning downtown Kenosha. Once he got to the riot, Rosenbaum saw Kyle Rittenhouse and immediately threatened to kill him. Rosenbaum then chased Rittenhouse and tried to pull the gun from his hands. When he did that, Kyle Rittenhouse shot him.\\nSo Joseph Rosenbaum died as he had lived, trying to touch an unwilling minor. At this point, Rittenhouse ran to find police. A mob then chased him down the street, howling for his death. A rioter jumped on Rittenhouse and knocked him to the ground, another smashed him in the face with a skateboard. Yet another drew a loaded gun and pointed it in his face. Kyle Rittenhouse shot the second two men, one of them fatally.\\nSo those are the facts, and there\\'s no way to interpret them, except for what they are. The exercise of self-defense. Kyle Rittenhouse shot people so he would not be killed.\\nBut if you take a step back from the Rittenhouse story, you see something else entirely, you see violent insanity completely out of control in the middle of an American city. And the question is how did that happen in our country and why did nobody stop it?\\nPROSECUTORS COULD BE BARRED FROM RE-TRYING RITTENHOUSE IF PROSECUTORS INTENTIONALLY CAUSED MISTRIAL: EXPERT\\nAnd it wasn\\'t just happening in Kenosha, of course. Violent mobs at the same moment overwhelmed New York and Minneapolis and Portland and many other cities. They killed at least a dozen people. They caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. They burned businesses. They torched police stations. They bombed courthouses. They invaded suburban neighborhoods in the middle of the night purely to intimidate people because of their race.\\nDemocrats applauded all of this as it happened. Most Republicans just ignored it. And of course, the media lied about it. In Kenosha, the police barely even showed up. Officers in armored cruisers sat and watched as rioters torched a car lot with more than 100 vehicles in it. And they did nothing to stop the chaos.\\nThe question, then, is how exactly are we surprised when a 17-year-old lifeguard from Illinois decides to step in? They hate it when you say that, but it\\'s an entirely fair question. When legitimate authority refuses to do its duty, its sworn duty, others will fill the vacuum. That is always true. It\\'s a physics principle.\\nBut rather than acknowledge that obvious truth and accept the responsibility they bear, the people who made these riots possible in the first place decided instead to crush Kyle Rittenhouse. Joe Biden publicly called him a White supremacist, something for which someday we very much hope he is sued, because it\\'s totally outrageous and false. Members of Congress called him a domestic terrorist.\\nToday, Kyle Rittenhouse spoke for himself. See what you think.\\nWHO IS THE WISCONSIN JUDGE IN KYLE RITTENHOUSE TRIAL?\\nRITTENHOUSE: Once I take that step back, I look over my shoulder and Mr. Rosenbaum was now running from my right side and I was cornered from in front of me with Mr. Kaminski. And there were three people right there.\\nSo after a 10-minute break to compose himself, Kyle Rittenhouse returned to the courtroom and proceeded to blow up the prosecution\\'s claim that he had racked his rifle in a threatening manner. It turns out he didn\\'t rack his rifle at all. And video proved that. And then Rittenhouse explained why he turned himself in to police after the shootings.\\nRITTENHOUSE: People were saying, cranium him and get him, kill him. The people were screaming, and I just was trying to get to the police running down Sheridan Road.\\nDEFENSE: You say ‘I\\'m trying to get to the police.\\' Why were you trying to get to the police?\\nRITTENHOUSE: Because I didn\\'t do anything wrong. I defended myself.\\nDEFENSE: Did you feel as though there was safety where the police were?\\nRITTENHOUSE: Yes.\\nSo they didn\\'t really have a response to that since it\\'s all on videotape. It\\'s provably true. So instead, the lead prosecutor in today\\'s case, who is essentially an NPR pledge drive donor called Thomas Binger, took a very different tact. He went on to imply that Kyle Rittenhouse must be guilty because he had exercised his constitutional right to remain silent after he was arrested.\\nBINGER: Since August 25th, 2020, this is the first time that you have told your story. Since August 25th, 2020, you\\'ve had the benefit of watching countless videos of your actions that night, correct? … You\\'ve also had the opportunity to listen to the testimony of all 30-some witnesses that have testified in this trial so far. Correct?\\nRITTENHOUSE: Yes.\\nBINGER: And after all of that, now you are telling us your side of the story. Correct?\\nRITTENHOUSE: Correct.\\nBINGER: I am making the point that after hearing everything in the case now, he\\'s tailoring his story to what has already been introduced.\\nJUDGE BRUCE SCHROEDER: The problem is, this is a grave constitutional violation for you to talk about the defendant\\'s silence, and that is, your right, You\\'re right on the borderline, and you may be over, but you\\'d better stop.\\nThis is day one of law school stuff, but just to be clear, exercising your constitutional rights is not an indication that you are guilty. It is a sign that you are American. It is your birthright.\\nThe government\\'s own lawyer does not understand that, which you think might get the attention of Merrick Garland\\'s Justice Department. Which, after all, is in charge of justice in this country. But no. Merrick Garland is not interested, just as he has ignored the thugs videotaping jurors outside the courthouse. The judge in this case seems pretty well fed up with all of it today. He ruled that prosecutors could not mention statements about shoplifters that Kyle Rittenhouse apparently made weeks before the shootings. Prosecutors asked Rittenhouse about them anyway, and once again, the judge was forced to shut down the trial.\\nJUDGE SCHROEDER: I indicated a bias towards denial is what I did. Held it open with a bias towards denial. Why would you think that that made it okay for you without any advance notice to bring this matter before the jury? … I was astonished when you began your examination by commenting on the defendant\\'s post-arrest silence. That\\'s Basic Law. It\\'s been Basic Law in this country for 40 years, 50 years. I have no idea why you would do something like that, and it gives - well, I\\'ll leave it at that. So I don\\'t know what you\\'re up to.\\nYou can watch televised trials for the next 10 years and never hear a judge talk like that, that\\'s how completely out of control the prosecution in this case is. At this point, it\\'s not even clear it\\'s going to make it to a jury. The defense has asked the judge to dismiss the case without the possibility of a retrial, and the judge indicated he might very well grant that request. So again, what you are watching is willful prosecutorial misconduct. It\\'s an intentional perversion of justice, and the judge very well knows that.\\nJUDGE SCHROEDER: I had heard nothing in this trial to change any of my rulings.\\nBINGER: That was before the testimony, Your Honor.\\n…\\nJUDGE SCHROEDER: Don\\'t get brazen with me. You knew very well, you know very well that an attorney can\\'t go into these types of areas when the judge has already ruled without asking outside the presence of the jury to do so. So don\\'t give me that.\\nYeah, don\\'t give me that. Exactly. Good for the judge. We should tell you we\\'re so used to evaluating everything through a partisan lens that it\\'s worth noting the judge in this case was appointed by a Democrat. The point is, however, he still believes in the Constitution. That\\'s always the point. Kyle Rittenhouse should be very grateful he\\'s the judge in this case.\\nYesterday, the prosecutors tried to bully a freelance photographer, Nathan DeBruin. In return, that turned out to be a mistake, DeBruin ratted them out on live television.\\nPROSECUTOR: Mr. De Bruin, you said there was a lot of tension in the room when you met with me and Mr. Binger and Ms. B. Is it fair to say that you were very nervous?\\nDEBRUIN: Yeah, absolutely.\\nPROSECUTOR: And had you read over your statement, right?\\nDEBRUIN: Correct.\\nPROSECUTOR: And we asked if you knew anything beyond that statement.\\nDEBRUIN: Correct.\\nPROSECUTOR: We didn\\'t ask you to change it.\\nDEBRUIN: Yes, you did.\\nSo pressuring a witness to change his statement? Right. That\\'s exactly the kind of justice that Kyle Rittenhouse has received from the government so far. No one that has been paying attention is surprised by any of this. Ghouls, like Joe Biden, politicized this case day one.\\nWhat\\'s terrifying and very unnerving to anyone who lives in this country is the number of institutions that joined the Democratic Party in trying to prevent Kyle Rittenhouse from getting a fair trial, which again, is your birthright as an American.\\nHere\\'s one example. In Virginia, Police Lt. Col. William Kelly was fired from his job for daring to donate to Kyle Rittenhouse\\'s legal defense. Kelly was a 20 year veteran of the Norfolk Police Department. He had three children and a wife with cancer. For disagreeing with Joe Biden\\'s view of the Rittenhouse case the department dismissed him without a pension.

Neither is evidence of “fraud.”\\nTrump falsely claimed that Biden supports the Medicare for All plan. He never did.\\nBiden got it wrong when he claimed there was “15% less violence” during his time in office than today. The violent crime rate dropped under Trump.\\nTrump misleadingly claimed people “weren’t allowed to watch” the polls in Philadelphia. Only satellite elections offices, where voters can return mail-in ballots, are open now.\\nTrump claimed he had been endorsed by the sheriff in Portland, which isn’t true, and he suggested that Biden had gotten no support from law enforcement officials, which is false.\\nTrump boasted that he “brought back 700,000 manufacturing jobs,” which was never true. Currently 237,000 have been lost.\\nTrump denied that climate change plays a role in California’s wildfires. Scientists say it’s a contributing factor.\\nBoth candidates gave potentially misleading impressions of when Americans can expect a COVID-19 vaccine.\\nBiden said 10 million people lost their employer-sponsored insurance during the pandemic, but the study he relies upon also said all but 3.5 million of them would regain insurance from another source.\\nBiden said Trump’s Supreme Court nominee has “written … that she thinks the Affordable Care Act is not constitutional.” Not quite, though she faulted a 2012 opinion upholding the law.\\nTrump claimed that “drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%.” Actually it’s not clear what the impact of his executive orders will be.\\nTrump said Biden called military members “stupid bastards,” which Biden denied. The vice president did use those words while addressing troops overseas in 2016, but his campaign has said it was in jest.\\nTrump wrongly said Biden “forgot the name” of his college. Biden in 2019 said he “started out of … Delaware State,” but a university official said Biden was referring to announcing his Senate bid on campus.\\nTrump said that he has “given big incentives for electric cars.” He’s actually tried to eliminate programs to encourage their manufacture and sale.\\nBiden falsely claimed that Trump didn’t try to send experts to China early in the coronavirus pandemic.\\nTrump said when Biden was working on the 1994 crime bill, he called African Americans “super-predators.” Actually, that was a phrase famously uttered by Hillary Clinton — not Biden — about some “gangs of kids.”\\nTrump said “I don’t think” Kellyanne Conway, his former White House counselor, said “riots and chaos and violence help his cause,” as Biden claimed. Conway did say something like that.\\nBiden wrongly claimed that the United States has “a higher deficit with China now than we did before” in talking about trade. The deficit is actually lower.\\nTrump claimed that in relaxing the Obama administration’s more stringent fuel economy standards, cars would be $3,500 cheaper. Even going by the administration’s analysis, that’s inflated.\\nAnd there were more claims on topics including veterans, the economy and preexisting conditions.\\nThe two presidential candidates debated on Sept. 29 in Cleveland. Fox News’ Chris Wallace was the moderator.\\nAnalysis\\nTrump’s Flimsy Election ‘Fraud’ Case\\nMaking his case that mail-in voting has already resulted in large scale “fraud,” Trump cited two examples that are not evidence of fraud at all.\\n“There’s fraud,” Trump said. “They found them in creeks. … They sent two in a Democrat area. They sent out a thousand ballots, everybody got two. This is going to be fraud like you’ve never seen.”\\nIn recent days, Trump has referred to ballots found in a ditch or a riverbed or, as he did during the debate, “in creeks.” Law enforcement officials in Wisconsin reported that three trays of mail were found Sept. 21 along the side of a road and in a ditch next to a highway in Greenville. Officials there said the batch of mail included “several” absentee ballots, though a Postal Service spokesman would not comment on whether those were completed ballots, or blank ones being sent to voters, according to the Post Crescent. The paper quoted the county clerk saying election officials started to mail out ballots to voters on Sept. 17.\\nAs for the claim about a thousand people being sent two ballots, that’s true. As NBC4 in Washington reported, election officials in Fairfax County, Virginia, believe up to 1,000 people who requested mail-in ballots may have gotten two by mistake. But it’s not evidence of fraud. Those people who got two ballots won’t be able to vote twice.\\nFairfax County Registrar Gary Scott said that when every ballot is returned, “we make an entry into their voter record that they have returned a ballot. So if something else shows up, the ballot has already been returned. We can’t count that ballot.”\\nAnd despite Trump’s repeated warning about large-scale fraud with mail-in voting, as we have noted, while the instances of voter fraud via mail-in or absentee ballots are more common than in-person voting fraud, the number of known cases is relatively rare.\\nIt’s Biden’s Health Plan, Not Sanders’\\nTrump interrupted Biden’s discussion of his health plan to falsely claim that Biden supports Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All plan. The president wrongly claimed that the two rivals for the Democratic nomination agreed to it in the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force Recommendations report.\\nTrump: Joe, you agree with Bernie Sanders — who’s far left — on the manifesto, we call it, and that gives you socialized medicine. Are you saying you didn’t agree?\\nBiden does not agree with Sanders’ plan. The task force report reflected Biden’s health care plan — which he unveiled in July 2019 during his primary fight with Sanders and others.\\nBiden’s plan, among other things, offers a Medicare-style public health insurance option as a choice and increases tax credits for individuals purchasing insurance on the exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act. His website says his plan to “build on the Affordable Care Act” will “insure more than an estimated 97% of Americans.”\\nHere’s what the task force report says: “Democrats believe we need to protect, strengthen, and build upon our bedrock health care programs, including the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Veterans Affairs system. Private insurers need real competition to ensure they have incentive to provide affordable, quality coverage to every American. To achieve that objective, we will give all Americans the choice to select a high-quality, affordable public option through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.”\\nTrump also said “you’re going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care,” another reference to Medicare for All. Again, Biden doesn’t support that plan.\\nViolent Crime\\nBiden was wrong when he said there was “less violence” during his time as vice president than there is “today.”\\nBiden: When we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today.\\nIt’s true that the number of all violent crimes per 100,000 people declined 15.7% during the Obama-Biden years (even taking into consideration a 6.5% jump in their final two years). That may have been the point Biden wanted to make.\\nBut the same FBI figures contradict Biden’s claim that there was less violence then than “today.” Annual figures show that last year’s violent crime rate was 5.1% lower than in 2016. Furthermore, the decline seems to have continued into the first half of 2020 according to “preliminary” semiannual FBI figures, despite an alarming 14.8% increase in the number of homicides, compared with the same six months in 2019.\\nTrump’s Misleading Remarks on ‘Bad Things’ in Philadelphia\\nNear the end of the debate, Wallace asked whether the candidates would urge their supporters to refrain from civil unrest and also pledge to withhold declaring victory until the election results are certified.\\nTrump said he was “urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully” and then said: “As you know today there was a big problem. In Philadelphia, they went in to watch — they’re called poll watchers. It’s a very safe, very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren’t allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia, bad things.”\\nThe day marked the first day that the city opened satellite elections offices — where residents can register to vote, or request and return mail-in ballots — and at least one woman who reportedly claimed to be a poll watcher for the Trump campaign was barred from entering a satellite office in an elementary school.\\nBut the Trump campaign doesn’t have any approved poll watchers in the city, elections officials told the Philadelphia Inquirer, and the satellite offices in operation are not the same as Election Day polling locations — so poll watchers don’t have the same privileges.\\nAl Schmidt, a Republican and a city commissioner who oversees elections, told the Inquirer: “We don’t give someone a poll watcher certificate to … watch somebody fill out their ballot at their kitchen table.”\\nNick Custodio, a Philadelphia deputy commissioner, said in a statement to NBC News that the “Satellite Offices are not Polling Places. Poll watcher certificates have not been issued for any individuals for anything other than poll watching activities on Election Day at Polling Places.”\\n“Individuals who are not seeking to receive services from a Satellite Office are not permitted to be there for other purposes,” the statement said. “This is particularly important in the current environment as City buildings and offices remain closed to the public due to COVID-19.”\\nLaw Enforcement Endorsements\\nTrump touted his support from law enforcement organizations, but he was wrong to claim the support of a Portland, Oregon, official. He also went too far in claiming that Biden got no similar endorsements.\\n“Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, ‘I support President Trump,’” Trump said, looking across the stage at Biden. “I don’t think you have any law enforcement. You can’t even say ‘law enforcement.’”\\nBoth of those things are wrong.\\nThe sheriff in Multnomah County, which includes the city of Portland, took to Twitter to clarify that he has not endorsed Trump.\\n“In tonight’s presidential debate the President said the ‘Portland Sheriff’ supports him. As the Multnomah County Sheriff I have never supported Donald Trump and will never support him,” Sheriff Michael Reese tweeted.\\nPortland rose to national prominence after federal agents arrived there this summer as protests against police brutality and racism boiled following the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in police custody in May. At the end of July, federal agents agreed to step back and local authorities took over. Reese had expressed concern about the conduct of the federal agents at the time.\\nTrump has, however, received the endorsement of another sheriff in an area that’s recently gotten national attention — David Beth, the sheriff in Kenosha, Wisconsin, is supporting the president’s reelection bid. Kenosha drew protests following the police shooting of Jacob Blake in August.\\nAs for the suggestion that Biden has garnered no support from law enforcement officials, that’s false. The former vice president is backed by more than 175 current and former law enforcement officials.\\nManufacturing Jobs\\nBiden and Trump sparred over manufacturing jobs, but neither gave an accurate account.\\nTrump: I brought back 700,000 [manufacturing] jobs; they brought back nothing. Biden: Even before COVID … manufacturing went into a hole.\\nThe fact is, 237,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost between the time Trump took office and August, the most recent month for which figures are available.\\nTo be sure, there was a gain of 499,000 (but not 700,000) between Trump’s inauguration and November of last year, when the number peaked a few months prior to the COVID-19 pandemic’s arrival.\\nFrom there they slipped a bit but didn’t exactly go “into a hole,” as Biden claimed — declining by only 62,000 by the time Trump declared a national COVID-19 emergency in March. That was followed by a two-month plunge of nearly 1.1 million manufacturing jobs, fewer than half of which have since been regained.\\nFurthermore, Trump was wrong when he said Obama-Biden “brought back nothing.” Yes, 578,000 jobs were lost during their first four-year term, which included the Great Recession that had begun in 2007 and raged for months after they took office. But 386,000 jobs were in fact “brought back” in their second term.\\nClimate Change & Wildfires\\nIn an exchange with Wallace, Trump reluctantly acknowledged that greenhouse gases warm the planet “to an extent” but insisted that better forest management could solve California’s wildfire problem.\\nIn fact, scientists’ best estimate is that human activities, including human-produced greenhouse gases, are responsible for more than 100% of the observed warming of the Earth. And while improved forest management techniques can help reduce the risk of some wildfires, climate change and other factors, including humans living in wildfire-prone areas, are also important.\\nWhen Wallace asked the president what he believed about climate change, Trump sidestepped the question, saying, “I believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air, immaculate water, and do whatever else we can that’s good.”\\nWhen pressed again on whether he thinks greenhouse gases contribute to the global warming of the planet, Trump said, “I think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes.”\\nHe added, “But I also think that we have to do better on forest management of our forests,” explaining that he gets calls about wildfires in California every year, and that “if you had good forest management, you wouldn’t be getting those calls.”\\nTrump then went on to point to Europe’s “forest cities,” saying that those places avoid fires because they maintain their forests, while California burns “down because of a lack of management.”\\nAs we’ve written, Trump is wrong to say that fires only occur because of poor management and to suggest that human-sourced greenhouse gases are only a small component of warming.\\nAs University of California, Los Angeles climate scientist Daniel Swain told us earlier this month, the Earth “is warming due to the increased atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases resulting from human activities.” Climate change, he said, “is acting as a pervasive force across the landscape and is increasing the severity of wildfire across a wide range of vegetation types–meaning that climate change is an important factor in understanding the severity of *all* of the fires currently burning.”\\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Timing\\nAs he has before, Trump exaggerated the best estimates for when a COVID-19 vaccine will be made available to the American public, claiming that the vaccine companies “can go faster” than the time frames previously provided by government officials.\\n“Well, I’ve spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner,” Trump said in response to Wallace’s point that both Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield and Operation Warp Speed chief adviser Moncef Slaoui have said that a vaccine might not be widely available to the general public until the summer.\\nThe president went on to suggest, without evidence, that any delay would be political.\\n“They can go faster than that by a lot,” Trump said of the vaccine companies, adding that “we’re going to deliver [vaccines] right away” when Wallace clarified that he was talking about a vaccine for the general public.\\nTrump is correct that the government plans on shipping vaccines within 24 hours of an authorization by the Food and Drug Administration, but that doesn’t mean all doses would be immediately available to non-prioritized Americans.\\nAssuming one or more shots are found safe and effective, initial doses for prioritized groups may be available by the end of the year or in early 2021, with members of the general public getting doses after that.\\n“We may have enough vaccine by the end of the year to immunize probably, I would say, between 20 and 25 million people,” Slaoui told NPR earlier this month. “And then we will ramp up the manufacturing of vaccine doses to be able to, based on our plans, have enough vaccine to immunize the U.S. population by the middle of 2021.”\\nBiden wasn’t specific about which groups he had in mind when he gave his expected time table for vaccine distribution, but his description left out the possibility of some people receiving shots in 2020.\\n“Every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year,” he said. “But the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning or the middle of next year to get it out.”\\nAgain, if a vaccine passes FDA muster, it is plausible a subset of the prioritized population could be immunized this year.\\nConway on Violence\\nBiden and Trump disagreed on whether former White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway said “riots and chaos and violence” happening in certain cities “helps” Trump. Conway did say something along those lines, as Biden said.\\nBiden: You know his own former spokesperson said, you know, riots and chaos and violence help his cause. That’s what this is about. Trump: I don’t know who said that. Biden: I do. Trump: Who? Biden: Kellyanne Conway. Trump: I don’t think she said that.\\nBiden was referring to comments Conway made during an Aug. 27 appearance on “Fox & Friends.”\\nOne of the show’s hosts asked Conway if protests for racial justice that turned violent in several cities, including Kenosha, Wisconsin, were all “Donald Trump’s fault,” as some had suggested, including Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana.\\nConway said “no,” and added that Trump was the one “trying to get law and order restored.”\\nShe later said she had seen a quote that day from an unnamed restauranteur in Wisconsin who asked, “Are you protestors trying to get Donald Trump reelected?”\\n“He knows full stop, and I guess Mayor Pete knows full stop, that the more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is for the very clear choice on who’s best on public safety and law and order,” Conway said, indicating Trump was the “clear choice.”\\nBiden Spins Health Care Plan Losses\\nBiden said that 10 million Americans lost their employer-based insurance coverage during the COVID-19 recession. A study did find that, but it also said most would regain insurance from another source, leaving 3.5 million of them uninsured.\\nBiden: He is not for any help for people needing health care because, he, in fact, already has cost 10 million people their health care that they had from their employers because of his recession.\\nThat figure comes from an Urban Institute study, though the study said most of those 10 million would regain insurance from another source.\\nThe Urban Institute estimated that job losses would cause 10.1 million people to lose their employer-sponsored coverage from April through December. But many would switch to insurance through another family member, Medicaid or the individual market, leaving 3.5 million uninsured in the end.\\nUrban Institute, July 13, 2020: We find that 48 million people will live in families with a worker who experiences a COVID-19-related job loss in the last three quarters of 2020. Of them, 10.1 million lose employer coverage tied to that job. We estimate 32 percent of these people switch to another source of employer coverage through a family member, 28 percent enroll in Medicaid, and 6 percent enroll in the nongroup market, mainly in marketplace coverage with premium tax credits. Still, we estimate 3.5 million people in this group become uninsured.\\nThe study also said about 500,000 people who were uninsured before the economic impacts of the coronavirus would become eligible for Medicaid and enroll. That would result in a net 2.9 million uninsured.\\nOther estimates give higher figures for the uninsured. Families USA, which advocates for “health care consumers,” estimated that 5.4 million laid-off workers had lost health insurance between February and May, adding that the estimate didn’t include family members of those workers who also would have lost coverage.\\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 26.8 million could lose employer insurance as of May 2. The vast majority of those — 79% — would be eligible for subsidized coverage, either through Medicaid or tax credits to help purchase coverage on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. But KKF said it “did not estimate take-up or enrollment in coverage options but rather only looked at eligibility for coverage.”\\nVA Deaths\\nTrump said during the Obama-Biden administration, “you had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn’t provide them proper health care in the military.”\\nBut the Trump campaign said that is based on a 2015 report from the Veterans Affairs Office of the Inspector General that didn’t say those were all deaths of people who applied for VA health care, or that the deaths all occurred when Biden was vice president.\\nThe report, titled “Veterans Health Administration: Review of Alleged Mismanagement at the Health Eligibility Center,” said that, as of Sept. 30, 2014, 307,173 of nearly 867,000 “pending” applications for VA health care belonged to individuals who had died, according to the Social Security Administration.\\nBut, as we’ve written before, the report also said that poor record-keeping and data limitations made it impossible to say how many of those individuals died while waiting for care, how many of them had applied for care, or even how many of them were military veterans.\\nFurthermore, the report said 84%, or 258,367, of individuals who died with a “pending” application, died more than four years before September 2014, including some who died even before 1998, when the VA established its enrollment database. Former President Barack Obama and Biden took office Jan. 20, 2009.\\nUnplugging Electric Car Incentives\\nThe president claimed to support the manufacture and sale of electric vehicles during a portion of the debate on climate change, saying, “I’ve given big incentives for electric cars.”\\nBut his record doesn’t reflect that.\\nA 2019 report from the Congressional Research Service identified three federal programs that incentivize the manufacture or purchase of electric vehicles — the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, which supports production of fuel-efficient vehicles; the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, which are aimed at increasing fuel efficiency; and the Plug-In Electric Drive Vehicle tax credit, which gives tax credits to purchasers of electric vehicles.\\nAll three programs predate the Trump administration, and the president has proposed eliminating two of them.\\nIn his budget for fiscal year 2020, Trump proposed eliminating the Plug-In Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Tax Credit, which had been introduced in 2008. The following year, Trump sought to eliminate the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program in his 2021 budget proposal. That program had been established in 2007.\\nSending Disease Experts to China\\nBiden falsely charged that the Trump administration did not try to send experts to Wuhan, China — where the novel coronavirus outbreak emerged late last year — during the early stages of the pandemic.\\nBiden: He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was, he knew it was a deadly disease … we were insisting that the people we had on the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was. He did not even ask [President] Xi to do that. … He said we owe him a debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us.\\nThe former vice president has made similar inaccurate claims before. “[W]hen we were talking … early on in this crisis, we said — I said, among others, that, you know, you should get into China, get our experts there, we have the best in the world, get them in so we know what’s actually happening,” Biden said at a CNN virtual town hall on March 27. “There was no effort to do that.”\\nIn fact, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tried to get CDC personnel to the scene just one week after China reported the outbreak to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31, 2019, as we have written.\\n“On January 6, we offered to send a CDC team to China that could assist with these public health efforts,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said at a Jan. 28 press conference. “I reiterated that offer when I spoke to China’s Minister of Health on Monday, and it was reiterated again via the World Health Organization today. We are urging China: More cooperation and transparency are the most important steps you can take toward a more effective response.”\\nMore than a week later, Azar said again at a Feb. 7 press conference that “our longstanding offer to send world-class experts to China to assist remains on the table.”\\nIn mid-February a World Health Organization team including two Americans visited China, including Wuhan. The 25-member team, which visited China for nine days from Feb. 16 to Feb. 24, included one official from the CDC and another from the National Institutes of Health. The team issued a 40-page report on Feb. 28 — about two weeks before the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic.\\nAt a briefing of the White House coronavirus task force in March, Trump said that he brought the issue up with Chinese President Xi Jinping personally.\\nTrump, March 22: And I did ask him whether or not we could send some people, and they didn’t want that — out of pride. I think, really, out of pride. They don’t want — they don’t want us sending people into China, to help them. You know, China is a strong country. They have — they have their scientists and they have their doctors — very smart. A lot of people. And, you know, but I did discuss that about sending our people in. And, they didn’t really respond. We went again; they didn’t respond.\\nPreexisting Conditions and the ACA\\nBiden said Trump was “in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act” and that “there’s a 100 million people who have preexisting conditions and they’ll be taken away as well, those preexisting conditions, insurance companies are going to love this.” Trump replied: “There aren’t 100 million people with preexisting conditions.”\\nThere are 100 million people with preexisting conditions, not including those with Medicare or Medicaid coverage, according to one estimate from the consulting firm Avalere. It’s unclear what Biden meant when he said “they’ll be taken away as well,” but if the ACA were nullified, they would lose the preexisting condition protections in that law. But only those who seek coverage on the individual market — where those without employer or public insurance buy plans – would be at risk of being denied insurance.\\nAs we’ve written before, the Trump administration has backed a lawsuit to invalidate the ACA, which instituted sweeping protections for those with preexisting conditions. The ACA prohibited insurers, in any market, from denying coverage, charging more or excluding coverage of certain conditions based on health status.\\nBefore the ACA, those buying plans on the individual market could face denials or higher premiums based on their health. But only 6% of the population gets coverage on the individual market.\\nEmployer-based coverage — where 49% of the population gets insurance — couldn’t deny insurance, before the ACA. But those plans could decline coverage for some preexisting conditions for a limited period, if a new employee had a lapse in coverage.\\nIt’s unclear what preexisting condition protections would be implemented under the Trump administration in lieu of the ACA, but Trump signed an executive order on Sept. 24 that said “access to health insurance despite underlying health conditions should be maintained” even if the ACA were struck down in court.\\nBiden also said that if the Trump-backed lawsuit were successful, it “will strip 20 million people from having insurance.” That’s a reference to the number who gained insurance under the ACA, according to a few estimates.\\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2017 that if the ACA were repealed and not replaced with new legislation, the uninsured would increase by 32 million over 10 years. (However, “some people would choose not to have insurance,” CBO said, because they had coverage in order to avoid a penalty. That penalty was eliminated effective in 2019.)\\nAmy Coney Barrett on the ACA\\nBiden said Trump’s Supreme Court nominee — Judge Amy Coney Barrett — has “written … that she thinks the Affordable Care Act is not constitutional.” Not quite, though she faulted a 2012 opinion upholding the law.\\nBarrett did criticize Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion in NFIB v. Sebelius, which upheld the ACA but found states couldn’t be forced to expand Medicaid under the law. Writing in January 2017 in the Notre Dame Law School journal, Barrett reviewed a book by Randy Barnett. She said: “In NFIB v. Sebelius, the inspiration for Barnett’s book, Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. He construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power; had he treated the payment as the statute did—as a penalty—he would have had to invalidate the statute as lying beyond Congress’s commerce power. … Barnett is surely right that deference to a democratic majority should not supersede a judge’s duty to apply clear text. … If the majority did not enact a ‘tax,’ interpreting the statute to impose a tax lacks democratic legitimacy.”\\nThat’s clearly a critique of Roberts’ opinion. But some legal scholars have said the writing doesn’t indicate how Barrett might rule on the ACA case now before the court: California v. Texas. That case concerns whether the elimination of the ACA tax penalty under the 2017 GOP tax law makes the individual mandate (the requirement for most people to have insurance) unconstitutional — and if without the mandate, the entire law must be struck down.\\nNicholas Bagley, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, told NBC News Barrett’s journal article “doesn’t tell us anything about how she’d rule in a case that’s significantly weaker.” He said that “ACA supporters should be concerned” but “[n]ot panicked.”\\nPrescription Drugs\\nTrump said: “I’m cutting drug prices. I’m going with favored nations. … Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%.” Trump signed four executive orders on drug prices in late July, but it remains to be seen how the orders will be implemented and whether they will result in large reductions in prices.\\nAs we’ve explained, the orders, which largely revive past administration proposals, require the Health and Human Services secretary to take various actions, such as moving through the federal rule-making process.\\nTwo of the orders pertain to Medicare beneficiaries. Another order concerns insulin and epinephrine for low-income individuals, and the fourth involves allowing the importation of some drugs.\\nTrump’s reference to “favored nations” concerns an updated executive order signed Sept. 13. It calls on the HHS secretary to test payment models to tie Medicare drug prices to the lowest price among comparable countries that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\\nAn HHS spokesperson told us in July that Medicare “currently pays roughly 80% more than other countries” for Part B drugs, which are outpatient drugs administered by a physician. But again, whether this policy could lead to an 80% reduction for those drugs remains to be seen.\\nCDC Director on Face Masks\\nOn the topic of face masks, Biden wrongly claimed Trump’s “own head of the CDC said … if everybody wore masks and social distanced between now and January, we’d probably save up to 100,000 lives.”\\nThat was a projection from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation — not Dr. Robert Redfield.\\nOn Sept. 3, IHME said its model projected there would be 410,000 cumulative U.S. deaths from COVID-19 by January 2021, and that 122,000 of those deaths could be prevented with increased mask use. As of Sept. 24, the model downgraded its estimate to a total death toll of 372,000 in the U.S., 97,000 of which could be avoided with near-universal masking.\\nRedfield, though, did say in congressional testimony on Sept. 16 that face masks “are the most important, powerful public health tool we have” against COVID-19.\\n“I will continue to appeal for all Americans, all individuals in our country, to embrace these face coverings,” he said. “I’ve said it, if we did it for six, eight, 10, 12 weeks we’d bring this pandemic under control. … We have clear scientific evidence they work and they are our best defense. I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine.”\\nLater that day, on Twitter, he added: “The best defense we currently have against this virus are the important mitigation efforts of wearing a mask, washing your hands, social distancing and being careful about crowds.”\\nBut that’s not the same as saying “100,000 lives” could be saved by wearing masks.\\nBiden’s ‘Stupid Bastards’ Remark in Context\\nBiden at one point made reference to a recent story by the Atlantic that, citing anonymous sources, reported that Trump privately denigrated fallen soldiers as “losers” and “suckers.” Trump later returned to the point by denying the claim and suggested it was actually Biden who spoke ill of the military.\\n“What he did, was he said — he called the military stupid bastards,” Trump said.\\n“I did not say that,” Biden responded.\\n“And he said it on tape,” Trump continued.\\nBiden did use those words during a trip to Abu Dhabi in March 2016, and it is on tape. But the full context of the video suggests that Biden was joking, which his campaign has maintained.\\nAfter Biden referenced “the incredible sacrifices you make for our country,” he went on to tell the crowd that he has “incredibly good judgment.” He mentions marrying his wife, Jill, then refers to having nominated Lt. Karen Johnson to attend the U.S. Air Force Academy years earlier. Johnson was on stage.\\n“One, I married Jill. And two, I appointed Johnson to the academy. I just want you to know that,” he said. “Clap for that, you stupid bastards.” He then jokingly called the group a “dull bunch.”\\nBiden “was jokingly encouraging the audience to clap for an airwoman on the stage,” his campaign said in a recent statement to the Daily Beast.\\nDelaware State\\nTrump distorted the context of comments Biden made in 2019 to claim that Biden wrongly said he attended college at Delaware State University, one of the nation’s historically Black colleges and universities, when he actually went to the University of Delaware.\\n“You said you went to Delaware State but you forgot the name of your college,” Trump said. “You didn’t go to Delaware State.”\\nThe origin of Trump’s claim is a story in the Washington Times, which included a clip of Biden at a town hall event in Florence, South Carolina, on Oct. 26, 2019, in which he said, when discussing funding for HBCUs, “I got started out of an HBCU, Delaware State.” The paper stated that while Biden “declared last year on the campaign trail that he began his academic career at Delaware State University,” a university official confirmed he was never a student there.\\nThat official, Carlos Holmes, the university’s director of news services, says his response was used in a ”dishonest light.”\\n“Watched in full context, it is clear that Biden was discussing his long association with Historically Black Colleges and Universities, not making a claim that he had attended Delaware State University,” Holmes told Delaware State News. “He ‘got his start’ when he announced his first run for the US Senate on our campus in 1972 with then-Delaware State College President Luna Mishoe at his side. For three decades, first as US Senator and then as Vice President, Joe Biden has been our advocate and partner to such a critical extent that in 2003 the University awarded him an honorary doctorate.”\\nTrump Wrong on ‘Super-Predators’\\nTrump repeatedly claimed that when Biden was spearheading the 1994 crime bill, he called African Americans “super-predators, and they’ve never forgotten it.” Actually, that was a phrase famously uttered by Hillary Clinton — not Biden.\\n“I never said it,” Biden responded, but Trump continued to insist he did.\\nWe looked into this when Trump made a similar claim in a Fox News interview a month ago, and we couldn’t find any evidence that Biden has used that term.\\nAs then-chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden did spearhead the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Although the bill received bipartisan support at the time, it has been criticized for some of its provisions, such as mandatory minimum sentencing, and its impact on mass incarceration, particularly of Black men. As we have written, the trend of increasing imprisonment began well before 1994, but experts told us the 1994 law exacerbated the issue.\\nAs we said, it was actually Hillary Clinton who used the phrase “super-predator” in a 1996 speech at New Hampshire’s Keene State College in support of the 1994 crime bill, which was signed by her husband, then-President Bill Clinton.\\n“They are not just gangs of kids anymore,” Clinton said. “They are often the kinds of kids that are called ‘superpredators.’ No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.”\\nInterestingly, Trump often criticized Clinton during her 2016 presidential bid for using that term, and Clinton has since acknowledged, “Looking back, I shouldn’t have used those words, and I wouldn’t use them today.”\\nTrump’s Swine Flu Spin\\nIn criticizing the Obama administration’s handling of the 2009 H1N1 flu, Trump told Biden “you were a disaster — your own chief of staff said you were a disaster.”\\nRon Klain, Biden’s former chief of staff, last year said the Obama administration “did every possible thing wrong,” but he said he was talking about delays in the production of a vaccine — not the administration’s overall response. The record supports Klain.\\nAt a May 14, 2019, Pandemic and Biosecurity Policy Summit, Klain said the administration has “a bunch of really talented, really great people working on it and we did every possible thing wrong.” Klain’s comments following that assessment focused solely on the rollout of vaccines.\\n“What did that [the experience in 2009] tell us? It told us that the vaccine will arrive late,” Klain said at the pandemic policy summit. “It told us that if it’s not prepared in advance, it will arrive late. If we don’t have the answer before, we’re not going to get the answer in time. And it told us that our systems for deciding how to distribute and administer a vaccine in the time of crisis are going to be badly, badly tested.”\\nShutting Down the Economy\\nOn the subject of reopening businesses that were closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, Trump said several times that Biden “wants to shut down the country.”\\nWe don’t know what Biden wants to do, but he did say last month that he’d be willing to shut down the economy if scientists said it was necessary. He has since said he doesn’t think that will be necessary.\\nIn an Aug. 21 interview with ABC News, Biden was asked: “If you’re sworn in come January, and we have coronavirus and the flu combining, which many scientists have said is a real possibility, would you be prepared to shut this country down again?”\\nBiden said, “I will be prepared to do whatever it takes to save lives because we cannot get the country moving until we control the virus.”\\nWhen asked for clarification, he responded, “I would shut it down, I would listen to the scientists.”\\nIn a press conference more than a week later, Biden said another shutdown would likely not be needed if certain steps were taken.\\n“There’s going to be no need, in my view, to be able to shut down the whole economy,” Biden told reporters Sept. 2. “I got asked by David Muir a question, if I was asked to shut everything down. I took that as a generic question if — am I going to follow the science? I am going to insist — and I insist now, without any authority, that every responsible person in this country, when they’re out in public or not with the cohort that they have lived with because they know they haven’t spread it to their husband, wife, etc., that they wear a mask and keep socially distanced.”\\nTravel Restrictions to Fight COVID-19\\nTrump falsely said that Biden had opposed the travel restrictions the president imposed on China on Jan. 31 in an effort to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus. Biden did not say he opposed them at the time. And he later said he endorsed them.\\nTrump also said that if he had listened to Biden and not imposed the restrictions, millions of Americans would have died rather than 200,000. There is no evidence to support the claim that the travel restrictions saved so many lives.\\nTrump: If we would have listened to you, the country would have been left wide open. Millions of people would have died, not 200,000. … I closed it and you said he’s xenophobic, he’s a racist and he’s xenophobic. Because you didn’t think we should have closed our country.\\nAs we have written, Biden’s campaign said on April 3 that Biden backed Trump’s decision to impose travel restrictions on China. “Joe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy,” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, told CNN. “Science supported this ban, therefore he did too.”\\nTrump has frequently said, as he did at the debate, that Biden called him “xenophobic” for imposing the restrictions. Trump is right that Biden called him xenophobic. But Biden didn’t make clear why he said that. The Biden campaign has said that was not in connection with the China travel restrictions.\\nAs we have written, on the day the White House announced the restrictions, Biden said at a campaign event in Iowa that as the pandemic unfolds, Americans “need to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it.” He added, “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.” The Biden campaign said Biden’s “reference to xenophobia was about Trump’s long record of scapegoating others at a time when the virus was emerging from China,” and that he was not talking about the travel rules.\\nAs for whether the restrictions saved millions of lives, as we reported, there is no evidence to support this, and the White House has provided none. The few studies that have been done estimate travel restrictions the United States and other countries enacted on China had modest impacts, slowing the initial spread outside of China but not containing the coronavirus pandemic. Past studies also have found travel restrictions could delay the path of the spread of diseases, but do little to contain them.\\nFinally, Trump didn’t “close” the country. The restrictions, which went into effect Feb. 2, barred certain non-U.S. citizens who had traveled to China within the previous two weeks from entering the United States. But U.S. citizens and permanent residents and their immediate families were exempt from the restrictions.\\nA New York Times story on April 4 found that nearly 40,000 people had flown on direct flights from China to the United States in the two months after the restrictions went into effect. So this was hardly a closure.\\nNuking Hurricanes?\\nBiden said that Trump “has an answer for hurricanes, he said maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them.” The president shot back, “I never said that at all. He made it up.”\\nThe back story: Axios reported on April 25, 2019, that Trump had proposed just that. Its story said, “President Trump has suggested multiple times to senior Homeland Security and national security officials that they explore using nuclear bombs to stop hurricanes from hitting the United States, according to sources who have heard the president’s private remarks and been briefed on a National Security Council memorandum that recorded those comments.”\\nTrump denounced the story in a tweet at the time as “FAKE NEWS.”\\nOne of the story’s authors, Jonathan Swan, tweeted back that he stood by the story, adding that the president “said this in at least two meetings during the first year and a bit of the presidency, and one of the conversations was memorialized.”\\nThe issue has not been authoritatively settled.\\nTrade Deficit with China\\nBiden wrongly claimed that the United States has “a higher deficit with China now than we did before” in talking about trade. That was the case two years ago, but not now. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the trade deficit in goods and services with China hit a record amount at $380 billion nominal dollars in 2018. But the trade deficit fell in 2019 to $308 billion — which is slightly below the $310 billion trade deficit in Barack Obama’s last year in office in 2016. Figures from the past 12 months (ending in June) show a deficit of $273.3 billion, 12% less than what it was in 2016.\\nFuel Economy Standards\\nWhen Wallace asked Trump why he had relaxed fuel economy standards for vehicles “that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks,” Trump responded, “Well, not really, because what’s happening is that the car is much less expensive and it’s a much safer car and you’re talking about a tiny difference.”\\n“And then what would happen, because of the cost of the car, you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased,” he added. “We have the old slugs out there, that are 10, 12 years old. If you did that, the car would be safer, it would be much cheaper, by $3,500.”\\nTrump is referring to his administration’s Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient Vehicles rule, which replaced the Obama administration’s stricter set of fuel economy standards. At the core of the policy is the idea that by reducing fuel standards, that would make new cars cheaper, allowing people to replace older and potentially less safe vehicles.\\nBut as we’ve explained before, the administration’s analyses that underpinned that argument were widely viewed as faulty and contrary to the basic principles of economics.\\nTrump’s $3,500 figure is incorrect, even by the administration’s own analysis. According to the final rule, which calls for increasing fuel efficiency by 1.5% every year instead of 5%, the cost of a new vehicle is estimated to be $977 to $1,083 lower, on average — a good deal less than $3,500.\\nWhile Trump also claims the difference to the environment is “tiny,” the government estimates that around 1.9 to 2.0 additional barrels of fuel will be consumed, or the equivalent of 867 to 923 additional million metric tons of carbon dioxide. That’s around half a year’s worth of greenhouse gas emissions from the nation’s entire transportation sector.'], 'https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-may-be-impeached-second-time-new-obstruction-evidence-emerges-2019-12': ['business.com', 'Trump May Be Impeached Second Time If New Obstruction Evidence Emerges', 'Tom Porter', datetime.datetime(2019, 12, 24, 11, 1, 12), 'The House of Representatives could file a second set of articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump if former White House counsel Don McGahn provides further evidence of wrongdoing, justice committee lawyers argued in a court filing.\\nThe Democrat-led justice committee is seeking McGahn\\'s testimony as part of its impeachment probe, but Justice Department lawyers claim that Trump\\'s impeachment last week renders McGahn\\'s testimony obsolete.\\nMcGahn resigned his position in October 2018, and served as a star witness for Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig)\\nWASHINGTON (AP) — A close associate of President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani is claiming Trump was directly involved in the effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden.\\nLev Parnas says he delivered an ultimatum in May, at Giuliani’s behest, to the incoming president of Ukraine that no senior U.S. officials would attend his inauguration and vital American security aid would be withheld if an investigation into Biden wasn’t announced.\\nHe said Trump was aware of Giuliani’s efforts to secure an investigation and the president was briefed regularly.\\nIf true, Parnas’ account undercuts a key Republican defense of Trump during the impeachment investigation — that Trump’s withholding of vital military aid to Ukraine last summer wasn’t a quid pro quo for Biden investigations.\\n“President Trump knew exactly what was going on,” said Parnas, a Soviet-born Florida businessman facing a raft of criminal charges related to campaign finance violations. “He was aware of all my movements. I wouldn’t do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani, or the president.”\\nFor his part, Trump on Thursday repeated denials that he is acquainted with Parnas, despite numerous photos that have emerged of the two men together , including at a April 2018 dinner with about a half dozen others at the president’s Washington hotel.\\n“I meet thousands and thousands of people as president. I take thousands of pictures,” Trump said, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office. “I don’t know him, I never had a conversation that I remember with him.”\\nParnas made several potentially explosive claims in an extended interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, segments of which were aired Wednesday and Thursday.\\nThe day after Parnas said he delivered the message, the State Department announced that Vice President Mike Pence would no longer be attending the inauguration of Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskiy.\\nParnas alleged that Trump ordered Pence to stay away at the behest of Giuliani to send a clear message to the incoming Ukrainian administration that they needed to take seriously the demand for an investigation into Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate seen as a potential threat to Trump’s 2020 reelection.\\nParnas said every communication he had with Zelenskiy’s team was at the direction of Giuliani, whom he regularly overheard briefing Trump about their progress by phone.\\nGiuliani called Parnas’ statements “sad.”\\n“I feel sorry for him,” Giuliani said Wednesday in a text message to an AP reporter. “I thought he was an honorable man. I was wrong.”\\nAsked directly if Parnas was lying, Trump’s lawyer replied, “I’m not responding yet.”\\nParnas said he also heard Giuliani and another Trump-aligned defense lawyer, Victoria Toensing, briefing Attorney General William Barr by phone about their efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government to announce the investigation into Biden and his son Hunter’s business dealings.\\n“Barr was basically on the team,” Parnas said.\\nThe Justice Department said in September that Trump had not spoken to Barr about having Ukraine investigate the Bidens and that the attorney general had not discussed Ukraine with Giuliani. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said Wednesday that Parnas’ claims were “100% false.”\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nToensing posted on Twitter that Parnas “absolutely lied” about her conversations with Barr.\\nPence, who Parnas said raised the need for an investigation into the Bidens in a September meeting with Zelenskiy in Poland, added to the flurry of denials issued Thursday.\\n“I don’t know the guy,” said Pence, who has himself been photographed standing with Parnas. The vice president called Parnas’ claim that he had participated in the effort to spur the Ukrainians to open an investigation into the Bidens “completely false.”\\nParnas also said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Energy Secretary Rick Perry played roles in the scheme. Both have denied wrongdoing.\\nThe new accusations came as House Democrats made public a trove of documents, text messages and photos from Parnas’ smartphones that appear to verify parts of his account.\\nThe documents, released just ahead of the start of Trump’s Senate impeachment trial, could raise pressure on the Senate as it debates whether to hear witnesses.\\nA federal judge earlier this month ruled that Parnas could provide the materials to Congress as part of the impeachment proceedings. Democrats voted in December to impeach Trump for abuse of power and for obstruction of Congress.\\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, one of seven Democratic impeachment managers who will effectively act as prosecutors during Trump’s Senate trial, said Thursday they are reviewing Parnas’ interviews and documents “to evaluate his potential testimony.” It is likely that the House managers, not senators, would make a motion to call witnesses such as Parnas.\\n“Mr. Parnas’ public interviews in the last 24 hours shed additional insights into the origins of the scheme, the work he and Rudy Giuliani were doing on the president’s behalf, and other members of the administration who were knowledgeable,” Schiff said.\\nBut Senate Republicans appeared largely unmoved, with some suggesting they were unfamiliar with who Parnas is, despite months of media coverage and prior testimony in the House about his ties to Giuliani’s efforts in Ukraine.\\n“If I had ever heard of him before yesterday I’m not aware of it,” said Sen. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican. “This is the indicted guy, right?”\\nHouse Republican leader Kevin McCarthy deflected questions about donations from Parnas to a political action committee he runs and a photo of him with Parnas at Trump’s inauguration in 2017.\\n“People come to events, and they take photos with me,” McCarthy said. The GOP leader added that in his view Parnas “lacks all credibility″ and accused the news media of trying to build him up.\\nDemocrats, meanwhile, pointed to text messages among the newly disclosed materials that have raised questions about the possible surveillance of former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch before she was ousted by the Trump administration last spring.\\nThe messages show that Robert F. Hyde, a Republican candidate for Congress from Connecticut, disparaged Yovanovitch in messages to Parnas and gave him updates on her location and cellphone use.\\nFBI investigators were observed Thursday morning at Hyde’s home and business addresses. Charles Grady, a spokesman for the FBI in Connecticut, confirmed that agents had been at the locations tied to Hyde but said he could not provide additional information.\\nThe text and phone records show Parnas communicating with Giuliani multiple times a day before Yovanovitch’s removal, as well as a handwritten note that mentions asking Ukraine’s president to investigate “the Biden case.”\\nAmong the documents is a screenshot of a previously undisclosed letter from Giuliani to Zelenskiy dated May 10, 2019, which was shortly after Zelenskiy was elected but before he took office. In the letter, Giuliani requests a meeting with Zelenskiy “as personal counsel to President Trump and with his knowledge and consent.”\\nThe Associated Press reported in October that Zelenskiy had huddled three days earlier, on May 7, with a small group of key advisers in Kyiv to seek advice about how to navigate the insistence from Trump and Giuliani for a probe into the Bidens. He expressed his unease about becoming entangled in the American elections, according to three people familiar with the details of the three-hour meeting. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue, which has roiled U.S.-Ukrainian relations.\\nOne of the documents released by Democrats is a note from Parnas handwritten on stationery from the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Vienna that says “get Zalensky to Annonce that the Biden case will be Investigated.”\\nParnas told Maddow he took the notes as he was speaking by phone to Giuliani, receiving precise instructions about the demands Trump wanted to convey to Zelenskiy’s team.\\nTrump asked Zelenskiy in a July 25 call to investigate the Bidens. Hunter Biden served on the board of a gas company based in Ukraine.\\nIn a segment aired Thursday, Parnas said he no longer believes that former Vice President Biden did anything improper and said the concerted effort he’d been involved in to push for an investigation was just about politics.\\nParnas and his business partner, Igor Fruman, both U.S. citizens who emigrated from the former Soviet Union, were indicted last year on charges of conspiracy, making false statements and falsification of records. Prosecutors allege they made outsize campaign donations to Republican causes after receiving millions of dollars originating from Russia. The men have pleaded not guilty.\\nIn several of the documents released as part of the impeachment inquiry, Parnas communicated with Giuliani about the removal of Yovanovitch. The ambassador’s ouster, ordered by Trump, was at the center of the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry. Yovanovitch testified in the House impeachment hearings that she was the victim of a “smear campaign.”\\nTrump on the July call told Zelenskiy that Yovanovitch was “going to go through some things.” She had been recalled from her diplomatic post roughly three months earlier.\\nParnas told Maddow that Trump actually ordered Yovanovitch fired several times, including once in his presence, but Pompeo and then-national security adviser John Bolton refused to go along. Democrats and a handful of Republicans have been calling for Bolton to testify as part of Trump’s Senate trial.\\nOn April 23, just before Yovanovitch was directed to return to the United States, Giuliani texted Parnas, “He fired her again.” Parnas texted back, “I pray it happens this time I’ll call you tomorrow my brother.”\\nAfter texting about the ambassador, Hyde gave Parnas detailed updates that suggested he was watching her. In one text, Hyde wrote: “She’s talked to three people. Her phone is off. Her computer is off.” He said she was under heavy security and “we have a person inside.”\\nHyde texted Parnas that ″they are willing to help if we/you would like a price,” and “guess you can do anything in Ukraine with money ... is what I was told.”\\nIn a Twitter post Tuesday, Hyde called Parnas a “dweeb” and suggested the messages about surveilling the ambassador were a joke. He said he welcomed an investigation.\\nParnas, in turn, also said Wednesday that Hyde’s texts shouldn’t be taken seriously.\\nThe text messages show that Parnas consulted Giuliani in January 2019 after the U.S. denied a visa to former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin. Giuliani replied: “I can revive it.”\\nThe following day, Giuliani told Parnas, “It’s going to work I have no 1 in it.” Giuliani then predicted “he will get one,” before giving Parnas the phone number for Jay Sekulow, the leader of the president’s personal legal team. Sekulow is expected to be part of Trump’s legal team during the impeachment trial.\\nAmong the materials released from Parnas’ phone this week were more photos of him with Trump, as well as the president’s son Donald Trump Jr., first daughter Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner.\\nAsked by Maddow about Trump’s denial of knowing him, Parnas said he had spoken one-on-one with the president numerous times.\\n“He lied,” Parnas said of the president. “I mean, we’re not friends. Me and him didn’t watch football games together, we didn’t eat hot dogs. But he knew exactly who we were, who I was especially.”\\n___\\nAssociated Press writers Michael Balsamo, Lisa Mascaro, Zeke Miller and Matthew Daly in Washington, and Michael Melia in Hartford, Connecticut, contributed.\\n___\\nFollow Associated Press investigative reporter Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck , Mary Clare Jalonick at http://twitter.com/MCJalonick and Eric Tucker at http://twitter.com/etuckerAP\\n___\\nContact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org.\"], 'http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-tariffs-blur-lines-between-allies-and-enemies-european-central-bank-says/article/2651070': ['washingtonexaminer.com', 'Trump tariffs blur lines between allies and enemies, European Central Bank says', '', datetime.datetime(2018, 3, 8, 19, 34, 45), 'The immediate impact of President Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum won’t be that large, said European Central Bank President Mario Draghi.

In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me & others, so that almost all stories & news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative & Fair Media is shut out.

Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!”\\nThe president’s concerns seem to stem from an article published by PJ Media titled ‘96 Percent of Google Search Results for ‘Trump’ News Are from Liberal Media Outlets’. Written by Paula Bolyard, who describes her own article as “not scientific,” it suggests Google is prioritizing left-leaning news and deprioritizing conservative media outlets.\\nBolyard’s proof: She searched “Trump” in Google’s News tab and tallied up which news outlets appeared first, finding that websites she deemed left-leaning accounted for 96 of the top 100 results.\\nGoogle responded to Trump’s claim in a statement:\\n“Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don’t bias our results toward any political ideology,” the statement said. “Every year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users’ queries. We continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.”\\nTrump is right about one thing: Google’s algorithms do have biases, but they’re almost surely technological—not political.\\nGoogle prioritizes search results based on three key criteria: relevancy, freshnes, and authoritativeness. Some of that prioritization process is controlled by bots. For example, a story filed seconds ago by a major media outlet would score higher in the ‘freshness’ category and would therefore have a greater chance of appearing higher up in the search results. Similarly, a story would be considered more ‘relevant’ if its headline and the words in the article closely align with your search query.\\nAuthoritativeness is slightly trickier because it involves human input. Google hires thousands of ‘raters’ to score the authority of websites in an attempt to weed out spammy, low-quality websites and boost high-quality ones. These raters work under extensive guidelines that direct them to give low scores to websites designed to deceive users or promote hate, and give high scores to those that clearly label advertising, have won journalism awards or show positive reviews from users.\\nNews outlets that excel in these three categories are more likely to appear first in a Google news search. So, why did Bolyard’s search yield a disproportionately high amount of so-called liberal news outlets? One reason is the way she chose to measure the results.\\nSubscribe for counterintuitive, surprising, and impactful stories delivered to your inbox every Thursday Notice: JavaScript is required for this content.\\nBolyard used Sharyl Attkisson’s media bias chart to categorize which outlets were conservative or liberal. It’s a subjective and unscientific chart, but it seems generally correct in providing an indication of which way an outlet tends to lean. But there are far more liberal media outlets on Attkisson’s chart there are conservative ones. So, all other things equal, you’d expect a news search to return more liberal outlets simply because most media companies lean to the left.\\nUltimately, the precise inner workings of the algorithms are kept secret except to those who work for Google, even if the company is generally transparent about its search algorithm processes. Keeping this kind of information private is a common practice among tech companies like Facebook and Twitter, but it comes at a cost.\\n“Black box algorithms may be kept secret for business and intellectual property reasons, but they’re vulnerable to conspiracy theories,” Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, told WIRED. “There’s no way to know what the algorithm is doing for someone outside of Google or Facebook, or whatever tech company you’re talking about. And in some deeper, fundamental way, some of the machine learning algorithms, even the people working on them don’t fully understand what they’re doing.”\\nNyahn noted a flaw in Trump’s claim.\\n“The conceptual problem with Trump’s tweets is the idea that an algorithm is only fair if it returns an equally balanced number of stories favoring one side versus the other,” Nyhan told WIRED. “Take that to its logical extreme: Imagine if you searched for ‘does gravity exist,’ and Google had to return half of the search results saying, ‘actually it doesn’t.’ It’s a preposterous notion, but that’s the implication of the president’s claim here.”\\nTrump’s tweets come just weeks after tech companies like YouTube and Facebook removed pages and content belonging to the right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who claimed Silicon Valley is engaged in a liberal plot to shut out conservative media outlets for political purposes.\\nOn Tuesday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the administration is going to conduct “investigations and analysis” on the issue but said officials are “just looking into it.”'], 'https://www.npr.org/2020/02/19/807353165/barr-has-considered-resigning-over-trumps-remarks': ['npr', \"Barr Has Considered Resigning Over Trump's Remarks\", 'Brian Naylor Ryan Lucas, Brian Naylor, Ryan Lucas', datetime.datetime(2020, 2, 19, 11, 8), 'Barr Has Considered Resigning Over Trump\\'s Remarks\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP\\nAttorney General William Barr has told people close to him that he has considered resigning over his growing frustration with President Trump and the president\\'s public statements about the Justice Department and its ongoing cases, an administration official tells NPR.\\nIt is unclear whether the attorney general ever informed the president he was considering quitting, and for now, Barr remains at the department\\'s helm.

The impasse was proof of the president’s stark incapacity for leadership, which he reconfirmed Friday by threatening to re-shutter the government in three weeks.\\nIn announcing his non-deal with Congress — in fact, it is more cease-fire than solution — Mr. Trump rehashed his tired and truth-free arguments, asserting against logic and evidence that building a massive new border wall, to supplement hundreds of miles of barriers already in place along high-trafficked segments of the border, would cause crime to plummet and drug trafficking to dry up.\\nHe has lost that argument with the American people, a majority of whom oppose building the wall and blame him and Republicans in Congress for the shutdown, according to the latest Post-ABC News poll. Mindful of that, of the cascading economic costs related to the government closure and of the latest shutdown-related calamity — Friday’s massive flight delays along the Eastern Seaboard owing to a shortage of air traffic controllers — the president agreed to reopen the government until Feb. 15, with no new funding for a border wall for now. Score one for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), though no one is going to celebrate a national debacle such as this.\\nAdvertisement\\nIn the aftermath of such a pointless episode, the best hope is for Congress to step forward and shape a deal. It might include a new law, valid for at least the next two years, to prevent another shutdown. It would deliver back pay to low- and moderate-wage contract workers, such as security guards and cafeteria cooks, as Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and others have proposed. And it would combine some rational border security with some merciful immigration reform.\\nFollow Editorial Board 's opinions Follow\\nIn that last arena, the contours of a way forward are no secret. If Mr. Trump continues to insist on funding for a piece of wall, which he says is a matter of “no choice,” he should offer serious concessions on immigration to the Democrats — not the phony package peppered with poison pills that he rolled out a week ago, but a secure future for two groups whose protections from deportation he has tried to rescind: “dreamers” brought to this country as children by their parents, and migrants who have been living legally in the United States on temporary protected status, having fled unrest and natural disasters at home. For the dreamers, that would mean a path to legal status for 1.5 million or more of them who are eligible for the Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.\\nIf Mr. Trump resists that — if he reverts to another shutdown in which he again treats as pawns hundreds of thousands of the “incredible” federal workers he lauded on Friday — he will simply pile failure upon failure. If he declares an emergency as a means to divert federal funds for building a wall, he will invite litigation in what amounts to a profoundly undemocratic end run.\\nMr. Trump has failed as a dealmaker.

I address on its own terms Trump and his allies’ claim that, while president, he issued either a general or standing declassification order that covered these documents. If that is to be the defense on which the former president relies in the court of public opinion or in a court of law, we should understand the national security implications that would flow from such a presidential decision. It should be shocking to the American public and to jurors in a courtroom to hear such a line of defense to allegations of mishandling national defense information. That justifiable shock can come, however, only if people comprehend the grievous harms to national security from any such order.\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nFrom the FBI’s perspective, the August search was productive. The property receipt provided to one of Trump’s attorneys documented that the FBI had retrieved numerous documents including “Various classified TS/SCI documents,” “Miscellaneous Secret Documents,” “Miscellaneous Top Secret Documents,” and “Miscellaneous Confidential Documents.” “Top Secret,” “Secret,” and “Confidential” represent the three categories used to designate information as classified under the current Executive Order governing the classification of national security information the disclosure of which reasonably can be expected to cause damage to the national security. Under the criteria of that Executive Order, “Top Secret” information, if released, could cause “exceptionally grave damage” to U.S. national security. We also know that the January retrieval of documents from Mar-a-Lago included “the highest levels of classification, including Special Access Program (SAP) materials,” based on a letter the National Archives sent to Trump’s lawyers. And that trove of materials from January also included Special Intelligence, signals intelligence (including intercepts derived from authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act), and human clandestine sources, according to the redacted Affidavit submitted to the magistrate judge.\\nAdvertisement\\nSources and methods are the assets, techniques, programs, processes and capabilities used by the Intelligence Community to collect the substantive information that is analyzed, distilled, and provided to consumers of intelligence product ranging from the president of the United States, to cabinet secretaries, to high-ranking military officers, or to a platoon leader on the battlefield. Unlike substantive intelligence which is generally discernible from the intelligence report itself, intelligence sources and methods are usually not identified in an intelligence product. Consequently, many consumers possess little understanding of, or appreciation for, the fragility of the sources and methods used to produce any particular piece of intelligence and how those valuable, and perhaps irreplaceable, sources and methods might be compromised by a sophisticated foreign adversary coming into possession of the information that Trump and his allies now claim was “declassified” by his verbal “standing order.”\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nAs intelligence professionals know, sources and methods represent some of the Crown Jewels of U.S. intelligence activities and often involve collection programs and capabilities acquired through billions of dollars of investment and development under the highest levels of security. In many cases, those intelligence sources and methods are not only vital to U.S. national security but simultaneously are highly vulnerable to compromise or exploitation by sophisticated intelligence services of foreign adversaries. This singular combination of critical importance and unique fragility is reflected in the classification structures that have been developed, both by statute and executive order, to protect U.S. sources and methods.\\nCongress, for example, has enacted a statutory mandate requiring the DNI to “protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure” and to “establish and implement guidelines for the intelligence community” regarding “classification of information under applicable law.”\\nAdvertisement\\nThese responsibilities of the DNI are echoed in Executive Order 12333, which governs “United States Intelligence Activities” and tasks the DNI with “protecting, and ensuring programs are developed to protect, intelligence sources, methods, and activities from unauthorized disclosure,” and with establishing guidelines for Intelligence Community elements for “classification and declassification of all intelligence and intelligence-related information.” Similarly, Executive Order 13526, issued by President Obama in 2009, currently prescribes the “uniform system for classifying, safeguarding, and declassifying national security information,” and specific provisions within that Order identify “intelligence activities (including covert action), intelligence sources and methods, or cryptology” as a separately designated “classification category.”\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nThe importance and vulnerability of intelligence sources and methods also frequently dictate that any particulars relating to a source or method and the substantive information produced using those sources or methods be protected by rigorous special handling procedures. For example, the property receipt for the Mar-a-Lago search reflects that the FBI seized “various TS/SCI documents.” The “SCI” designation refers to “Sensitive Compartmented Information” a special security designation used with information of particular import. In the same statute where Congress tasks the DNI with protecting intelligence sources and methods, Congress also directs the DNI to “establish uniform standards and procedures for the grant of access to sensitive compartmented information” while ensuring “the consistent implementation of those standards and procedures throughout” the executive branch.\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nThe DNI has executed this congressional mandate through Intelligence Community Directive 703. That directive defines “Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI)” as “a subset of Classified National Intelligence” concerning or derived from intelligence sources, methods or analytical processes that is required to be protected within formal access control systems established by the DNI.” This is consistent with the statutory definition of SCI found in legislation which describes SCI as “classified material concerning or derived from intelligence sources, methods, or analytical processes that requires such information to be handled within formal access control systems.”\\nAdvertisement\\nAccording to IC Directive 703, the protection of SCI shall be accomplished through disciplined adherence to the proper application of a series of special handling protocols that include the requirement that “all SCI be processed, stored, used, or discussed in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility,” or SCIF.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe procedures and protections designed for handling SCI are not the only special handling provisions apparently violated by Trump’s actions. In a May 10, 2022 letter to one of Trump’s lawyers, the Acting Archivist noted that documents found in 15 boxes of records returned to NARA by Trump in January 2022 included more than 700 pages with classification markings “some include the highest levels of classification, including Special Access Program (SAP) materials.” “SAP materials” refers to the designation for “Special Access Programs” found in §4.3 of Executive Order 13526. These Programs are used with the most closely guarded of the nation’s secrets where “the vulnerability of, or threat to, specific information is exceptional” and the normal criteria used for determining access to information classified at the same level are not deemed sufficient to protect the information from unauthorized disclosure.\\nAdvertisement\\nFor example, if there is Top Secret information pertinent to a designated classified project but the normal criteria for protecting Top Secret information are considered inadequate to securely protect the information for this project, then a Special Access Program can be established by one of a very select group of individuals (the Secretaries of Defense, State, Homeland Security, and Energy, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence) to include more rigorous access and handling controls for the information related to that project. To further ensure security for these highly sensitive programs, SAPs are specifically intended to have access limited to a “reasonably small number of individuals commensurate with the objective of providing enhanced protection for the information involved.” A former senior intelligence official has described the network of SAPs as “its own ecosystem in the biodome of classified programs” while analogizing the purpose and effect of the access restrictions associated with SAPs in this way: “If a building contained classified information, many officials would have access to the facility. But the SAPs would be locked in a single room with only a handful of personnel provided keys — and only because they need the information to carry out their specific duties.”\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nColloquially, some SAPs are often referred to as “black” programs due to their extremely sensitive subject matter, highly limited access, and virtually nonexistent public visibility. By way of example, Special Access Programs may be (1) a small part of a less-highly classified acquisition program (for example, a highly sensitive guidance system used in an otherwise unclassified aircraft program may be protected as a special access program), (2) a major weapons program initiative like “stealth” aviation technology or submarine noise reduction technology, or (3) the most sensitive of NSA’s cryptologic activities.\\nNo one in the Intelligence Community with any level of familiarity with the access controls used with a Special Access Program would view Mara-Lago as a suitable location for storing any information related to SAP activities. That’s why Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah), a House Intelligence Committee member, told Politico, “I mean, if he had actual Special Access Programs — do you know how extraordinarily sensitive that is? That’s very, very sensitive. If that were actually at his residence, that would be a problem.”\\nAdvertisement\\nAll of the requirements associated with the handling of SCI and the operation of Special Access Programs confirm that the DNI cannot possibly protect intelligence sources and methods as mandated by both 50 U.S.C. § 3024 and Executive Order 12333 in a security environment where a president purports to declassify information orally, on spontaneous whim, without internal consultation with affected agencies or any sort of written record of his actions. Indeed, the Information Security Oversight Office, the implementing authority for Executive Order 13526, has issued an entire manual detailing the proper procedures and markings to be used in the classification (and declassification) of national security information.\\nAdvertisement\\nNot surprisingly, then, past practice confirms that a president’s decision to declassify a given document would first be memorialized in a written memorandum, usually drafted by White House counsel, which the president would then sign. Moreover, typically, the leadership of the agency or agencies with equities in the document would be consulted and given an opportunity to provide their views on the declassification decision. As the ultimate declassification authority, the president can decide to override any objections they raise but this process ensures, at minimum, notification to the cognizant agency and some level of consultation on the declassification decision. Then, once a final decision is made, and the relevant agency receives the president’s signed memorandum, the physical document in question would be marked — the old classification level would be crossed out — and the document would then be stamped, “Declassified on “X” date” by the agency in question.\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nThe enhanced protections mandated for SCI and Special Access Programs and their associated intelligence sources and methods accentuate the unacceptable dangers of compromise posed by an incautious, verbally issued “standing” declassification order. Declassification decisions reverberate through a vast U.S. intelligence apparatus that carefully tracks and handles information in accordance with the prescribed standards of Executive Order 13526. The coherent handling and safeguarding of the information that is the lifeblood of intelligence work, and the corresponding protection required for the sources and methods used to produce that information, are entirely dependent on community-wide confidence in the functioning of the system intended to provide that protection. In its manual for “Marking Classified National Security Information,” the Information Security Oversight Office emphasizes, for example, that “the marking of classified information shall not deviate from the prescribed formats and markings and shall be uniformly and conspicuously applied to leave no doubt about the classified status of the information, the level of protection required, and the duration of classification.”\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nThis acknowledged need for uniform handling in accordance with detailed instructions is all the more critical for the heightened security required for information designated as SCI or associated with a Special Access Program. Any intelligence professional who has been afforded access to SCI or to a SAP will attest that the general classification standards prescribed by Executive Order 13526 are augmented by a variety of additional access and handling protocols intended to secure the secrets associated not only with the substantive program information itself but often with the sensitive intelligence sources and methods used to collect that information. The notion that SCI or information associated with a Special Access Program can be “declassified” through haphazard, ad hoc verbal instructions, even from a president, is anathema to this Intelligence Community environment and introduces unnecessary chaos that carries entirely unacceptable risks of exposure to the intelligence sources and methods that the carefully structured classification system is designed to protect.\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nThe unique dangers posed to sources and methods often represent the most serious adverse consequence of a compromise of classified information; and at the same time such a compromise is also the impact most difficult to confirm and quantify. Picture, for example, a sophisticated adversary acquiring a document previously classified as Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) but now “declassified” pursuant to Trump’s unwritten “standing” order. By careful analysis, a foreign intelligence service might deduce that the substantive information in the now “declassified” document (1) was derived from NSA’s exploitation of a complex cryptographic system previously believed by the foreign adversary to be entirely secure and used to transmit that adversary’s most sensitive communications; or, (2) was derived from a uniquely positioned human intelligence source whose access, not to mention personal safety, is now entirely jeopardized; or, (3) was derived from a novel overhead collection system with capabilities completely unknown to the foreign adversary until exposed by the content of the substantive information in the “declassified” document. In any of these examples, the adversary may initiate countermeasures designed to deny further collection or seek to parlay its new insights into efforts to use these sources and methods for its own purposes of deception or disinformation.\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nCritically, then, where an intelligence source or method is compromised through a foreign intelligence service’s exploitation of a thoughtlessly “declassified” document not only is the substantive information in that document neutered but the future ability to obtain similar sensitive information is often lost or seriously degraded.\\nEven more dangerous than a recognizable loss of collection from a previously productive intelligence source is an adversary’s successful conversion of that source into a tool of deception or disinformation. In these circumstances, a formerly reliable source, whether it be a human agent or an exploited foreign communication system, now poses a perilous and, at times, undetectable threat to U.S. security. The mere suspicion that a foreign adversary may have converted a compromised source into an active tool to spread disinformation, even when not conclusively confirmed, can precipitate a loss of confidence that compels the U.S. Intelligence Community to abandon a valuable source or method with all the considerable associated costs in terms of expense and the loss of valuable intelligence accompanying such an abandonment. We have to assume such risks are posed by the documents derived from human sources that Trump retained at Mar-a-Lago (carrying the “HCS” codeword designation) and also those documents derived from the National Security Agency’s signals intelligence activities (carrying the ”SI” and/or “FISA” codeword designations) which rely heavily on masking from any adversary the degree of success NSA may have achieved in exploiting that adversary’s communications systems. Information identified as derived from each of these codewords is identified as such in the Affidavit for the search warrant.\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nThese costs are exacerbated where the potential compromise involves sources or methods generating SCI or associated with a SAP. The property receipt associated with the Mar-a-Lago search and the Acting Archivist’s May 10, 2022 letter confirm that the documents at Mar-a-Lago included both SCI and SAP information. An undocumented, ipso facto decision to declassify a particular document made by one with no genuine appreciation for the fragility and vulnerability of those sources and methods endangers not only the substantive intelligence content of that document but, more gravely in many scenarios, exposes the sources and methods used to collect that content to irreplaceable loss or potential co-optation by a foreign adversary for use in deception or disinformation operations. These legitimate concerns explain the intense interest that “the FBI and others in the Intelligence Community” have in reviewing the contents of the documents spirited away to Mar-a-Lago by the former president, as attested in the Acting Archivist’s May 10, 2022 letter.\\nAdvertisement\\nConsequently, the extraordinary sensitivity of the codeword designations used in the Mar-a-Lago documents conveys the serious repercussions for intelligence sources and methods of any Trump “declassification.” By virtue of such a “declassification” action, information previously protected by special access restrictions at a level above Top Secret is now arguably subject to release in response to any Freedom of Information Act request because it no longer qualifies for exemption by virtue of having been “declassified” since Trump carried it to the White House residence one evening. The introduction of this sort of chaos undermines the integrity of the classification system which, in turn, diminishes the confidence that intelligence professionals must possess in that system’s ability to securely protect their handling of the nation’s most sensitive secrets. Imagine, for example, the adverse impact on a covert operative who now carries a gnawing distrust that his secret identity is no longer entirely secure within a classification system where the ultimate classification authority may have little or no appreciation for the potential harms associated with “declassification” because he has neither the interest nor the energy to ensure that that classification system operates in the manner needed to protect those individuals who have put their lives at risk in service to the United States. Notably some of these disastrous effects result from Trump and his allies’ suggesting publicly that there was such a declassification order, even if there was not (and there most likely was not) one.\\nThe Mar-a-Lago search warrant represents only one chapter in an evolving drama. Whatever else lies ahead in this story, however, it is irrefutably true that the dangers associated with the possible compromise of those U.S. intelligence sources and methods used to collect the information contained in the documents haphazardly stored at Mar-a-Lago and used by the former president in presently unknown ways poses an immediate and ongoing threat to U.S. national security with potentially serious and disquietingly unknowable consequences.\\nMore From Just Security:\\nTerrorism Might Be the Least of Our Problems a Year After America’s Withdrawal From Afghanistan\\nAssessing Trump’s Claim of “Executive Privilege” on FBI Access to MAL Docs'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/13/democrats-2024-biden-alternative': ['theguardian.com', 'Joe Biden is deeply unpopular. But can Democrats find an alternative for 2024?', 'Ross Barkan', datetime.datetime(2022, 7, 13, 10, 26, 20), 'The Democrats find themselves with a 2024 conundrum. Joe Biden, the party’s standard-bearer, is widely disliked. A new poll found that a 64% of Democrats would want a candidate other than Biden to seek the nomination in two years. Rapid inflation has eaten away at the 79-year-old president’s popularity and he is viewed as increasingly out of touch, a vestige of another era that many voters want to leave behind.\\nAt the same time, Biden will easily win a Democratic primary if he runs again. Sitting presidents are rarely forced aside. The top candidates in a hypothetical primary don’t want to take him on – almost all of them ruled out the idea of waging a direct challenge. This is understandable, since no single governor or senator has the ability to defeat Biden, one-on-one. Democrats look warily to examples like Ted Kennedy, who ran a primary against President Jimmy Carter and was soundly beaten. Carter went on to lose the general election, in 1980, to Ronald Reagan.\\nWhat should be done? In an ideal world, Biden would recognize that he’ll turn 82 shortly after election day in 2024. There are plenty of Americans who are vigorous at that age, but none of them are governing large states or nations. Biden could fully deliver on the promise of his 2020 campaign that he would defeat Donald Trump and be a bridge to the next generation of Democrats. In not seeking another term, he could declare victory on a host of matters, like overseeing much-needed infrastructure funding and finally ending the war in Afghanistan. There are plenty of American presidents who have done less than Biden in one term.\\nIf Biden decides against another term, there will be a healthy open primary for the nomination. One problem for the Democrats is that the obvious frontrunner will be Biden’s vice-president, Kamala Harris. Though his poll numbers are slipping, Biden can still make the credible case that he can defeat Donald Trump a second time if Trump chooses to run again. Harris’s polling numbers are as frail as Biden’s, and she ran a very poor campaign for the presidency in 2019. Harris is simultaneously well-positioned to defeat any Democrat who takes her on, and is poorly suited for a general election, where she’d carry all the baggage of the Biden years without being able to summon the memory of Barack Obama, who Biden served with for eight years. A Kamala Harris 2024 campaign, for Democrats, could end up the worst of all worlds.\\nIdeally – and this would not happen, because Harris is ambitious – Democrats would find a way to hold an open primary without any of the candidates tied directly to the Biden administration. Beyond Biden, there are a growing number of Democrats across America who could be viable in a general election against Trump or Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, the most politically potent Republican hovering around 2024 right now. If they win re-election, Georgia senator Raphael Warnock and Michigan’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, could be top contenders, having won multiple times on forbidding swing turf. Warnock would be particularly strong as a charismatic Black candidate – he was a prominent pastor – with the potential to recreate Obama’s multiracial coalition. Colorado’s governor, Jared Polis, assuming he survives his 2022 re-election campaign, is another purple-state Democrat who would be an intriguing national candidate, having made a name for himself by defying liberals on unpopular Covid restrictions.\\nPart of Harris’s weakness is that, as a California senator, she was never battle-tested in a state where Democrats don’t dominate. Both JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, and Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, have the Harris problem: they run states where Republicans are increasingly impotent. As executives, they can argue, unlike legislators, they have to make tough decisions each day that affect millions of people. Pritzker is attempting to be a national leader on gun control and Newsom is taking on DeSantis directly, running ads in Florida promoting California as a place that won’t infringe on abortion rights and meddle in the classroom.\\nProgressives don’t have the equivalent of a Bernie Sanders, who is not going to run again. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is unlikely to run in 2024, when she will just turn 35, the age to be legally president. Like Ocasio-Cortez, Ro Khanna, a former Sanders campaign co-chair, is in the House, which is a historically tough place to mount a successful presidential bid. Both, though, could be strong future candidates, particularly if they win Senate seats.\\nFor now, Biden is emboldened. No prominent Democrat will cross him and he will feel especially motivated if Trump is back on the campaign trail.

News organizations wrestled with that question Sunday and Monday after President Trump tweeted a series of statements aimed at four members of Congress, all women of color. Trump’s comments — “Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came” — drew a thunderously negative reaction, with many people, especially Democrats, calling the tweets straight-up racist.\\nBut not everyone in the mainstream media was so direct.\\nReflecting a reluctance to use an incendiary term to describe Trump’s motives and behavior, some tiptoed around the word in their initial reports. Others stepped closer to the line, relying on phrases best described as “racist-adjacent,” such as “racially loaded,” “racially tinged” and “racially charged.”\\nAdvertisement\\nOn ABC News’s “World News Tonight” on Sunday, anchor Tom Llamas attributed the word to others: “Tweets critics are calling racist,” he reported, adding later that Trump is “being called racist.” The on-screen banner came closer to a flat declaration: “Racially charged tweet.” By Monday morning, “Good Morning America” host George Stephanopoulos was more explicit, introducing a news story by referring to “a series of racist tweeting” by the president.\\nOn “CBS Weekend News,” reporter Errol Barnett also sidestepped the issue, saying that Trump “stepped up his attacks on Democratic women.” He came closest by quoting a tweet by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) saying that “ ‘Make America Great Again’ has always been about making America white again.” By Monday morning, “CBS This Morning” referred to them as “racially charged” tweets.\\nFox News’s anchors and reporters avoided adopting the word throughout the day on Monday. In a midmorning report, anchor Bill Hemmer said Democrats were slamming “what they call racist comments.” He introduced White House correspondent John Roberts, who said the tweets were “drawing cries of racism.”\\nAdvertisement\\nDuring a brief presidential news conference Monday morning, Roberts told Trump that “many people saw the tweets as racist.” But neither Roberts nor Hemmer called it that themselves.\\nCNN, meanwhile, wasn’t so shy: Its hosts and on-screen graphics, known as chyrons, used the term as casually as if calling the summer weather “hot.” One on Monday afternoon put it bluntly: “Trump defends his racist attacks on U.S. congresswomen.” Another said, “GOP lawmakers mostly silent on Trump’s racist attack.”\\nNews organizations often debate how to describe controversial actions or statements in the most neutral way possible in an attempt to be evenhanded. During George W. Bush’s presidency, for example, newsrooms were divided over the use of the word “torture” to describe the administration’s tactics in interrogating terrorism suspects. More recently, the question has involved references to people who crossed international borders without authorization. Should they be called “undocumented workers,” “illegal aliens,” “migrants” or something else?\\nAdvertisement\\nThe use of “racist” in Trump’s case is similar to journalists’ reluctance to call him a “liar” or his many false statements “lies.” However, as the number of such statements has grown to five figures, some news organizations have dropped the euphemisms (“falsehood,” “misleading,” “baseless,” etc.) and now brand his repeatedly false utterances as “lies.”\\nArizona State journalism professor Dan Gillmor said news organizations are guilty of “weasel wording” when they avoid characterizing the president’s tweets as anything but racism. “My favorite [phrase], in a grind-your-teeth sense, is ‘racially tinged,’ ” which he called “visibly timid.” Gillmor, in an email, added, “It demonstrates journalistic weakness at a time when we need news organizations to be undaunted by the escalating attacks on the craft.”\\nIt’s unlikely that readers or viewers will miss the implications of news reports that refer to such controversies obliquely. But the issue may be credibility and trust: Many people, particularly people of color, have long harbored the suspicion that the news media underplay stories about race and racism.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe Washington Post initially avoided any direct characterization of the tweets, sticking to the reaction of others, in its news story about it Monday. However, later in the day, it began using the direct, unvarnished label.\\n“The Post traditionally has been cautious in the terminology it uses to characterize individuals’ statements, because a news organization’s job is to inform its readers as dispassionately as possible,” Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said in a statement. “Decisions about the terminology we use are made only after a thorough discussion among senior editors. We had that discussion today about President Trump’s use of a longstanding slur against African Americans and other minorities. The ‘go back’ trope is deeply rooted in the history of racism in the United States. Therefore, we have concluded that ‘racist’ is the proper term to apply to the language he used Sunday.”\\nFew news organizations have written policies about when the word can or should be applied.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe most nuanced policy may be the Associated Press’s, whose stylebook entry on race-related coverage says, “Reporting and writing about issues involving race calls for thoughtful consideration, precise language, and an openness to discussions with others of diverse backgrounds about how to frame coverage or what language is most appropriate, accurate and fair. Avoid broad generalizations and labels.”\\nIn this case, the AP had no qualms about how to refer to the tweet controversy. The headline on its main story on Monday read, “ ‘Many people agree with me’: Trump digs in on racist tweets.” It also tweeted, “President Trump, unbowed by criticism of his racist tweets targeting Democratic congresswomen, says ‘If you’re not happy here, then you can leave.’ ”\\nIn its main news story on the issue on Monday, the New York Times avoided adopting the phrase of its own accord and stuck with a less direct construction — that the tweets were “widely seen as racist.”\\nGiftOutline Gift Article'], 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/07/how-watch-first-jan-6-committee-hearing/7533670001/': ['usatoday.com', 'When are the Jan. 6 hearings going to be televised?

Madrigal', datetime.datetime(2018, 8, 29, 18, 47, 17), 'Tuesday, President Trump tweeted that Google “RIGGED” search results, saying “96 percent of news search results on ‘Trump News’ are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous.”\\nThe claim was originally made by Paula Bolyard, a writer at PJ Media, and got picked up by Lou Dobbs. Bolyard manually counted Google results for “Trump,” and found that of the top 100, no stories appeared from “National Review, The Weekly Standard, Breitbart News, The Blaze, The Daily Wire, Hot Air, Townhall, Red State,” while there were many stories from CNN, The Washington Post, NBC, The Atlantic, Politico, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and the like.\\nThe methodology PJ Media used to classify publications’ “bias” was questionable—The New York Times was ranked farther left than InfoWars is right—but Bolyard’s point wasn’t entirely off-base: Google does feature work by traditional media organizations more than insurgent conservative outlets.\\nOf course, Google’s ability to divine “quality” as distinct from “popularity” is limited. Search-ranking technology relies on the implicit votes of readers, with all the human biases that come bundled with them. Google, for its part, categorically rejected the claim that it tinkered with search results for political reasons. “When users type queries into the Google Search bar, our goal is to make sure they receive the most relevant answers in a matter of seconds. Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don’t bias our results toward any political ideology,” a spokesperson told The Washington Post. “Every year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users’ queries.”\\nThere you have it: Google says it is optimizing for relevant answers and high-quality content, not “political ideology.” But—and this is the part Google won’t say—what if relevance and quality are not equally distributed across the media?\\nThe Sunday shows set the agenda in Trump’s Washington\\nAs a thought experiment, pick some markers of relevance (timeliness, impact, keyword density) and quality (originality, sourcing, depth). Now apply a ranking algorithm to the work of the mainstream media, which is to say the big networks, papers, and digital sites that abide by traditional journalistic values. Then apply the same standard to the conservative publications that PJ Media bemoaned the lack of.\\nOf course the mainstream organizations—with larger staffs, generally better-trained journalists, and deeper roots in the field—would rank higher. The New York Times and Washington Post have thousands of journalists between them. Last year, The Times’ subscription revenue broke a billion dollars. The institutions of modern conservative journalism are simply not staffed or funded at the same level as what gets called the mainstream media.\\nMany right-wing outlets are embedded inside advocacy groups, like the Heritage Foundation’s The Daily Signal. Others are tiny blogs without the human resources to do original reporting: According to its staff page, HotAir, which Bolyard cited, has four editors (one of whom is pseudonymous). Even The Blaze, another outlet Bolyard cited, is reportedly down to fewer than 50 employees; the august Weekly Standard looks to have an editorial staff of only 35. Still other right-wing media organizations don’t adhere to the standards of journalism as the mainstream media recognizes them, peddling conspiracy theories or engaging in ethically questionable “reporting” practices or vowing to “break down the barriers between news and opinion, journalism and political participation.” Left-leaning outlets like Salon and DailyKos likewise shouldn’t expect to compete with The New York Times on Google placement.\\nAll media outlets have to reckon with the power of opaque platforms, and there is plenty to critique about Google’s attempts to rank news stories, let alone URLs. The company’s concept of “relevance,” for example, is caught in a strange loop between what people want and what people think it provides: Google sees pages as relevant if people engage with them, but people trust Google to serve up relevant things, so they engage with what Google shows them.\\nQuality is hard enough to define among journalism experts, and though some people have laid out indicators of credibility, Google has had a notoriously hard time defining what journalistic value means in machine-readable terms. Some things can be measured (How many fresh quotes are in a story from new sources? How many links are in the story to other high-quality sites? How many readers decided to spend a substantial amount of time with a story? How many different types of readers engaged with a story?), but none of them are airtight indicators of quality. The algorithm will rank plenty of great stories poorly. The system can, to a limited extent, be gamed. It’s far from perfect.\\nBut even if the methodology is flawed, Google applies it equally to all the media organizations in its news universe. It might not be a “free” marketplace of ideas, but it is a marketplace with fairly well-known and nonpartisan rules. If right-wing sites aren’t winning there, maybe Google isn’t the problem.\\nGoogle’s mission, as a private company, is to organize the world’s information. It has chosen certain computable ways of doing so and applied them across the media, regardless of the ideologies informing the reporters, editors, publishers, or funders of a media outlet.\\nThere is a reason that Microsoft’s Bing News or Apple News have nearly the same mix of news sources as Google News: By reasonable, measurable standards, those organizations are the ones reporting the state of the world best. Is it any surprise that the main right-leaning media organizations that do make the cut at Google are the Wall Street Journal and Fox News? Those two organizations have real reporters doing journalism that conforms to the industry’s standards.\\nIt would be great to have 10 Wall Street Journals out there doing the hard work of reporting on America. But that’s not what’s happening, and Google shouldn’t be forced to pretend that it is.'], 'http://townhall.com/columnists/markdavis/2016/10/31/will-the-reopening-of-hillarys-email-case-matter-n2238957': ['townhall.com', \"Will The Reopening Of Hillary's Email Case Matter?\", 'Mark Davis, Kurt Schlichter, Katie Pavlich, Townhall Staff, Spencer Brown, Matt Vespa, Leah Barkoukis, Victor Davis Hanson', datetime.datetime(2016, 10, 31, 0, 1), 'Make no mistake. I am enjoying the revival of FBI interest in Hillary Clinton’s email skullduggery as much as anyone eager to prevent her presidency. But as we move toward the final week of the election, I have to ask: how much is this really going to matter?\\nMy hope is that it matters greatly. I hope a few million Hillary voters have reached the snapping point and simply cannot support her any longer. And if they have, please understand that many may have voted already. If we learn nothing else from this chapter, can we please recognize the insanity of early voting? She may actually win by a margin of votes cast for her already, because we have allowed ourselves to marinate in the absurdity that convenience and greater turnout are the most important thing in an election.\\nBut to return to the matter at hand. FBI Director James Comey is on a political rotisserie spit, grilled by the left after weeks of torching by the flames of conservative indignation. But do not draw a false equivalency in those outcries. Clinton opponents were properly incensed when he detailed a strong case for indicting her in that infamous July statement, only to fail to recommend charges. Today, his re-opening of the case smacks of a decision to actually pay attention to facts and evidence.\\nHillary supporters are on solid enough ground when they observe the curiosity of Comey’s revelation of a re-opened case without much of a shred of specificity as to why. Under normal circumstances, perhaps investigators would have perused the relevant messages sufficiently to reveal a detailed rationale for additional investigation.\\nBut these are not normal circumstances. The FBI did not learn of these additional emails last week. The ticking clock grew louder, increasing the possibility of a bombshell revelation shaking loose as its subject was preparing to take the oath of office, or even after she had. That would not have been a positive development for an FBI whose director was already wounded by charges of corruption.\\nSo Comey sprang forth faster than he otherwise might have, leaving us with a story that is damaging to the frontrunner and useful to the pursuer. But how much? How many votes actually move as a result of this October surprise?\\nPolitical damage should always be measured in terms of supporters driven away. Benghazi, for example, has never hurt Hillary Clinton in any appreciable manner, because only conservatives care about it. Few, if any, who hold those offenses against her had any intention of voting for her anyway. Similarly, most of the people who considered the Billy Bush tapes a nuclear bomb were Trump-haters already. The only way for a story to sink teeth into a candidate is if it changes voting behavior.\\nPoll numbers had been tightening in recent days because attention was peeling away from sideshows and gravitating toward actual issues suggestive of the differences between a Trump and Clinton administration. It has always been a foggy matter to assess how much Hillary Clinton’s stunning levels of corruption were actually damaging her. It certainly did not restrain her from rising to poll leads that made many conclude the race was all but over.\\nBut it’s not. And now it’s really not. It will be mid-week before we have wide data on how much this new FBI probe has hurt her. It may not hurt that much at all. If Donald Trump wins this thing, it will be because he strung together a final-week push full of message discipline and sharply-defined policy differences. It will not be because James Comey rediscovered his duty to act based on what investigators find.\\nFor the new email story to be a factor, it will have to pry a wedge into an already identifiable enthusiasm gap. Enthusiasm alone does not lead to the presidency; ask Bernie Sanders, or Ron Paul. But in a campaign between candidates with roughly equivalent voter appeal, a close race can be tipped if supporters on one side are on fire with motivation while the others are more tepid.\\nFor evidence, return to the last election. 2012 was completely winnable for Mitt Romney, but due to some factors that were his fault and some that were not, millions of Republicans simply found him under-inspiring. Simultaneously, Barack Obama did not ride the wave of enthusiasm that lofted him in 2008, but there was enough left in that tank to fuel him past Romney for a second term.\\nPerhaps next Tuesday is the flip side of that coin. On paper, Hillary Clinton brings an impressive enough candidacy in terms of biography and fundraising. But a meager set of campaign skills and an underbelly of trust issues, even among Democrats, has kept her from closing the deal.\\nAnd perhaps the underestimated enthusiasm this time belongs to Trump. After a year of coverage of his massive rallies, it may seem odd to call his appeal underestimated, but it surely is, by all the smart kids in the enclaves of the elites. Those rallies mean nothing, they say; Hillary has a far better ground game, more money, more experience in the trenches.\\nAll true. And maybe this year, irrelevant. In the model of the Brexit vote, there is surely a hidden sliver of Trump appeal, fashioned from voters who avoid pollsters and various other traditional channels of publicizing their preference. It is impossible to know whether that will amount to one or five percent from state to state, but even if it’s in the middle there somewhere, throw in the wet blanket effect of this new FBI story, and the result is his campaign prospects brightening while hers dim.\\nEnough to make the difference November 8? Predictions are as foolish eight days out as they were eight months out. But it may not be the smartest thing for the Clinton campaign to insult the FBI director they loved mere weeks ago. And as they call for these new emails to be released, they know full well how unlikely that is. Their ploy to give off one last whiff of transparency is colossally outweighed by their behavior from the beginning of this tawdry tale.\\nThe air is thick with anticipation that the Clinton camp plans a November surprise to distract us from the October bomb that just detonated. But one wonders, even if they still have something up their tattered sleeve, if it will be as direct an indicator of what kind of presidency awaits.'], 'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/5955137ae4b0326c0a8d0e47': ['huffingtonpost.com', 'Connecting Students Across the Partisan Divide', 'Living Room Conversations Offers An Open-Source Format To Facilitate Structured Conversations Among People Of Differing Views, Backgrounds.

The city was eerily deserted on a Sunday evening, and I filled the space with scenes from civil rights films-- Klansmen parading down the sidewalk in defiance of sit- ins, and police dogs snarling at protesters. As darkness set in, I almost expected Bull Connor himself to dart out of the shadows, seize his bullhorn, and order me back onto the plane that had just brought me from Boston.\\nI am a teacher, and I was in Birmingham to meet a colleague who had agreed to connect his students with my own in Massachusetts to discuss civil rights, race, the Civil War... and each other. Our collaboration was meant to help students acknowledge stereotypes of the “other,” across the Mason Dixon line, but I’ll admit to having harbored my own preconceptions about life in Dixie. Three days after my arrival, though, I left Birmingham feeling that the city had not just weathered the Civil Rights Movement, but that it could teach Boston a thing or two about racial awareness.\\nMy visit left me reenergized to expose my students to kids with different points of view. Since then, middle-schoolers at Brookwood School in Manchester, MA have maintained a vibrant dialog with their counterparts at Highlands School, outside of Birmingham, and we have not shied away from difficult conversations. Many of my students openly think of southerners as racists and rednecks, and the southern students with whom we’ve been in touch characterize us northerners as bossy and rude. Kids have acknowledged these stereotypes, and, through sustained dialog, whittled away at them. Armed with a more robust common understanding, our students have worked on a mock Supreme Court hearing to decide whether a Tennessee school violated a student’s First Amendment rights when it blocked him from bringing a Confederate flag to school. The project is rich and layered, and it is immeasurably deepened by the participation of students from across the Mason Dixon line.\\nAdvertisement\\nIt turns out that I am not the only one trying to partner students across ideological divide to prepare them for tough work. I was thrilled to recently discover a program called Mismatch that looks to connect people, including students, across the political spectrum. This summer I will join an advisory group of educators to help Mismatch tailor their product to classroom teachers, and I’m intrigued by what I’ve discovered so far. Mismatch is the product of two organizations that I can’t believe I didn’t already know about. One of those, Living Room Conversations, helps people of dissimilar political viewpoints practice civil discourse, while the other, AllSides, helps the citizenry navigate bias by presenting news from the left, right and center. Joined together, they strive to do the very work I also have been attempting-- but on a larger scale.\\nWhen I was in Alabama, I stumbled into history in the making as I wandered past the outdoor wedding ceremony of a gay couple on the first day of same-sex marriage in that state. While I was taking my stroll, Alabama’s Chief Justice, Roy Moore, was gathering national attention for his order that local probate judges should ignore the recent federal court decision affirming gay marriage. In some areas — like the park through which I had unwittingly wandered — gay marriage was proceeding, while in other jurisdictions it was not. A cartoon in the local Birmingham paper mockingly depicted Moore clutching divine streaks of lightning while blocking the doorway to the 21st Century. When I returned home to Massachusetts, though, the nuances of the story vanished on Boston’s airwaves, leaving just stark headlines (“Alabama Blocks Gay Marriage”) to reinforce our long-held assumptions of the South. Had I not just been there, I would have had no sense of the layered controversy that Moore’s decision had ignited in Alabama; I needed to bust out of my familiar settings to see that event in a more informed way.\\nAdvertisement\\nWe adults have become notoriously entrenched in our own echo chambers, and I work hard to counter that tendency among my students. I am excited that, with the ideological and organizational backing of Living Room Conversations and AllSides, Mismatch may help me do so. The political divide that has grown so obvious to us all in recent times must, in part, be traced to our collective lack of experience confronting “the other,” and I hold great hope that Mismatch is one tool that can be deployed in the classroom to cultivate a network of schools that will help our students become more open-minded.'], 'https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-tariffs/trumps-tariff-hike-on-200-billion-of-chinese-goods-takes-effect-idUSKCN1SG08X': ['reuters.com', 'Trump ratchets up tariff threat after talks show no progress', 'David Lawder, Humeyra Pamuk', datetime.datetime(2019, 5, 10, 4, 5, 11), 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday ordered his trade chief to begin the process of imposing tariffs on all remaining imports from China, underscoring a lack of progress by U.S. and Chinese negotiators in talks aimed at ending an escalating trade war.\\nTrump’s move would subject about $300 billion worth of Chinese imports to punitive tariffs, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement.\\nLighthizer said a final decision has not been made on the new duties, which would come on top of an early Friday tariff rate increase to 25% from 10% on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.\\nDespite the escalation in tariffs, Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said they would press on with more talks, avoiding the worst-case scenario of a complete breakdown of negotiations between the world’s two largest economies.\\n“Over the course of the past two days, the United States and China have held candid and constructive conversations on the status of the trade relationship between both countries,” Trump said on Twitter.\\n“In the meantime, the United States has imposed Tariffs on China, which may or may not be removed depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations!” Trump said.\\nLiu later told Chinese state media that China and the United States had agreed to hold more talks in Beijing.

Behind the scenes, GOP activists are gleeful about the prospect of the FBI announcement helping to shift down-ballot races, as well as the presidential contest, in their favor.\\nGOP control of the Senate has looked in serious danger, and Republicans will try to stave off the possibility of losing their majority by pressing Democrats onto the defensive. One endangered GOP senator, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, told a Philadelphia radio station soon after the news broke that “it looks to me like Hillary Clinton is in a world of hot water.”\\nUncertainty on several key points is fueling the feverish atmosphere that has gripped the political world.\\nThe impact of the Comey announcement on public opinion cannot be reliably assessed because no major opinion polls have yet emerged that were conducted wholly in its aftermath.\\nBut a Washington Post/ABC News tracking poll released on Sunday, which included data from both before and after the revelation, carried ominous news for Clinton.\\nThe poll found that 34 percent of likely voters said they were “less likely” to vote for the Democratic nominee as a result of Comey’s announcement. A clear majority of those people were Republican or Republican-leaning, the Post reported, and therefore may never have intended to vote for Clinton.\\nBut 17 percent of those who said they had been deterred from backing Clinton leaned Democratic, and a further 9 percent were self-described independents. Any shift in their ranks could be pivotal in an election that appeared to be tightening even before the Comey bombshell.\\nAlso unknown is whether the FBI will make further comment on the matter before Election Day.\\nMany experts believe such comment is unlikely given that agents only obtained a search warrant to look through the relevant emails — some 650,000 — on Sunday.\\nThe ultimate conclusion to the matter could fall anywhere on a very broad spectrum.\\nThe emails, apparently found on a laptop once shared by close Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her estranged husband, former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), could be mere duplicates of messages already examined by the FBI during its probe of the private email server Clinton used while secretary of State. If that were the case, Clinton might benefit from a perception that she had been smeared — and criticism of Comey would reach a new level.\\nAt the other end of the range of possibilities, the emails could lead to the criminal indictment of a president-elect, a scenario that would envelop an already tense nation in chaos.\\nIf Clinton were to lose the election on Nov. 8, it seems all but certain that disappointed supporters of the Democratic nominee would blame the FBI. Trump has stated a number of times that he believes the process is “rigged” against him, spurring fears that his most fervent backers will not accept the legitimacy of the outcome if he loses.\\nTrump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, asserted that Clinton has “a very casual relationship with the truth” on ABC’s “This Week” Sunday. She was building on a case already made by the nominee himself, who reacted to the Comey announcement by arguing that “Hillary Clinton’s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before.” In a statement, he warned voters not to let the former secretary of State “take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.”\\nBut the Clinton team, moving past its initial shock at the news, has sought to shift onto a more aggressive footing. Campaign chairman John Podesta called Comey’s conduct “inappropriate” on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, while Clinton’s running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), asserted on ABC’s “This Week” that it was “completely unprecedented.”\\nThose comments were part of a broader effort by the Clinton campaign to undercut Comey. In talking points sent to surrogates on Saturday afternoon and obtained by The Hill, the campaign suggested emphasizing that the director’s actions were “extraordinary” and accused him of having created a “misleading impression.”\\nThe talking points also noted that both the Clinton and Trump campaigns were calling upon the FBI director to make more information available.\\nThe two sides clearly have diametrically opposed motives for making that request: the Clinton team believing it could be exculpatory and the Trump camp asserting it could be damning. But their appeals may be in vain, given that agents are only now beginning to look through the enormous cache of emails.\\nThe episode is just one more unprecedented twist in a campaign that has been chock-full of them.

President Trump has taken action before, firing cruise missiles at an airfield in Syria in 2017 after a horrible chemical weapons attack struck the town of Khan Shaykhun.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 21, 2019\\nPresident Trump ordered an attack on Iran on Thursday in retaliation for the downing of a surveillance drone in the Strait of Hormuz but called the operation off just before it was due to occur because it would have caused extensive casualties, he said Friday. In a series of morning tweets, Trump said he called off strikes on three Iranian sites minutes before they were to be launched because he was informed of the likely loss of life among Iranians. “We were cocked & loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights when I asked, how many will die,” Trump tweeted. “150 people, sir, was the answer from a General. 10 minutes before the strike I stopped it.” Such a death toll was “not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone,” Trump wrote, adding: “I am in no hurry, our Military is rebuilt, new, and ready to go, by far the best in the world.\\nNow, here’s the thing that is underscored by supporters of the president, but ignored by the anti-Trump masses out there. Isn’t this a sign that Trump is—gasp! — not a madman who has nuclear weapons at his disposal? I mean this is something that most of us knew already. There’s a difference between not liking one's style, which I can see why some people find off-putting, and being legitimately unbalanced. Remember how everyone was freaking out that nuclear Armageddon was upon us when Trump told North Korean leader Kim Jong-un that “fire and fury” would come down upon him if they mess with the U.S. guys! His tweeting could start a nuclear war because…'orange man, bad.’\\nTrump halted these airstrikes because the loss of life among Iranians was not proportional to the destruction of the U.S. drone. Some would argue that’s responsible. That’s how a superpower should act. It’s pretty much everything that was discussed in this episode of The West Wing if we want a popular culture example when the fictional president asks what's the virtue of a proportional response.\\nThe point is, I think even the most rabid anti-Trump Democrat probably thought that the president would lay waste to Iran over a drone. Like with North Korea, it didn't happen. Overall, they still call him dangerous. They still think he’s unstable. And yet, he nixed a military operation because the results, the action was not proportional. Now, just you wait; Democrats will soon be hitting him for acting too weak.\"], 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/05/27/twitter-fact-checks-trump-trump-cries-free-speech-scarborough-klausutis-column/5265167002/': ['usatoday.com', 'Twitter fact-checks Trump.

Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged & even illegally printed out & fraudulently signed.” He goes on to say the November election “will be rigged.”\\nNormally the tweet would have a standard life cycle. Twitter would do nothing. Trump’s followers would retweet his post. Trump’s detractors would tweet insults and responses. The news media would extend the tweet’s reach exponentially even as they reported it was false. And then the president would tweet again.\\nBut this time Twitter, already under fire for another false Trump tweet, announced that the president’s latest messages “contain potentially misinformation about voting processes and have been labeled to provide additional context around mail-in ballots.”\\nProviding more information is generally a positive thing, but somehow I don’t think this is going to be a deterrent. The president has inspired legions of fact-checkers with little impact.\\nBut why this message? Most surprising is that this particular tweet resulted in action by Twitter. It’s pure political hyperbole from a politician running for office. It’s not as though he accused someone of murder.\\nThat came earlier.\\nThe president used Twitter to attack former congressman and current MSNBC host Joe Scarborough and imply that he murdered an staffer who was found dead in Scarborough’s office in 2001. The medical examiner found that 28-year-old Lori Klausutis collapsed from an undiagnosed heart condition. No crime. No scandal.\\nTrump’s assault on the truth have understandably angered Scarborough, but the tweets have been devastating for Klausutis’ family, which has asked Twitter to take the posts down.\\n“The president of the United States has taken something that does not belong to him — the memory of my dead wife — and perverted it for perceived political gain,” Timothy Klausutis wrote to Twitter. Twitter immediately jumped into action, with a spokesman saying that they were “deeply sorry” about the emotional distress, and that the service would do absolutely nothing about it.\\nThat’s right. You can post harassing tweets and falsely accuse someone of crimes — as long as you’re a world leader.\\nI’m not kidding. While the Twitter Rules (yes, capitalized) bans “targeted harassment” or inciting others to harass, there’s a separate section for world leaders: “We review Tweets by leaders within the political context that defines them, and enforce our rules accordingly.” This, of course, explains the whole “do nothing” decision.\\nMore: China's hidden targeting of Donald Trump one reason Facebook needs new cybersecurity approach\\nTwitter argues that removing tweets “would hide important information people should be able to see and debate.” Yes, we know how difficult it is for the president to be heard.\\nIf Twitter applied its rules to all, controversial things would still be said and debated by the American people, on Twitter and off. Twitter just wouldn’t be an accomplice to falsehoods and harassment.\\nIt sometimes seems like Twitter didn’t go into this business with eyes wide open. Did it occur to them that those cute little bird chirps would become bludgeons in the hands of the powerful?\\nTwitter’s problem is that it wants it both ways — to be seen as both a bastion of free speech and as a respected communications service with standards. Mainly, it doesn’t want to tangle with Trump, its single most visible user, and his 80 million followers.\\nTwitter could go the true free speech route, even though as a private enterprise it has no First Amendment responsibilities. It could say “anything goes, have at it,” making it a true marketplace of ideas. But it would have no celebrities or businesses in the mix because they would be such an easy target of suddenly unregulated tweeters.\\nOn the other hand, Twitter could be a communications service with real standards that apply to all. It could encourage the free exchange of ideas globally, but say, “We stand for something here.”\\nMaybe today’s fact-check notice marks a shift. We’ll know soon. Is Twitter going to match Trump tweet for tweet? Picking the voter fraud tweet for the first response sets a pretty low threshold.\\nIn truth, the problem is that Twitter has decided to treat Trump differently. It ignored his violation of its standards because he’s president. It's fact-checking him because he’s president.\\nAnd that will lead to retaliation — because he’s president.\\nIn his latest tweet, Trump threatens Twitter and other social media companies with regulation. There’s an irony here. A private business is exercising its own free speech by adding a note to tweets, pointing users to a page with more information about the integrity of elections. In response, a government official is using his power to try to intimidate a private company into not speaking. There’s your First Amendment violation.\\nWe live in a nation blessed with free speech, but there are laws against using that speech to harass, coerce or cheat others.

Put aside the notion of whether Trump or anyone in his crew schemed with Russians on how to pull this off. Once the attack became public, Trump and his lieutenants continuously maintained it was nothing but a hoax. When the Democratic National Committee in June 2016 revealed it had been hacked by Russian operatives, the Trump campaign issued a statement huffing, “We believe it was the DNC that did the ‘hacking’ as a way to distract from the many issues facing their deeply flawed candidate and failed party leader.” After WikiLeaks released over 20,000 DNC emails right before the start of the Democratic convention the following month, the Hillary Clinton campaign tried to make the point this was Russian sabotage. Donald Trump Jr. and Paul Manafort hit the cable news shows to call this claim absurd. (Yet just weeks earlier, both had attended a secret meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian emissary, after being told this woman was bringing the campaign dirt on Clinton as part of a secret Kremlin plot to assist Trump.)\\nTrump led the denial charge himself. After being briefed in mid-August by US intelligence that Russia was behind the hack-and-dump operation against the Clinton campaign, he repeatedly declared that there was no reason to suspect Moscow was the culprit. He did this in speeches. And he did this in the debates with Clinton. At their first face-off, he said the perp “could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?” And following the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence’s release of a statement in early October 2016 stating that intelligence showed Russia was indeed behind this attack, Trump still vigorously insisted there was no reason to believe Moscow was involved.\\nThroughout this period, Russia, of course, was denying it was doing anything untoward. So Trump was echoing Putin’s disinformation. He was pushing Moscow’s line and dismissing the US government’s official finding. That made it easier for Russia to get away with the covert operation. With Trump very publicly challenging the notion that an attack was underway, Republican leaders—most notably, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)—were disinclined to join the Obama administration in any effort to challenge or thwart Putin’s assault on the US political system. Trump provided Putin cover.\\nHe continued to do so after the election. When the US intelligence community in January 2017 released an assessment confirming Russia had engaged in this information warfare and noting that this had been done in part to boost Trump’s chances, Trump refused to acknowledge the conclusions or to take clear action against Russia. Rather, he assailed the intelligence community, comparing it to Hitler’s regime. (“Are we living in Nazi Germany?” he tweeted.) And he stuck with this course through the first year of his presidency. After meeting with Putin at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in November 2017, Trump told reporters on Air Force One, “He said he didn’t meddle. I asked him again. You can only ask so many times.” Trump added: “Every time he sees me, he says, ‘I didn’t do that’, but I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.” Trump continued, “I think he’s very insulted by it.”\\nEven though his administration has taken some actions against Russia—such as expelling Russian diplomats after the nerve agent attack in England—Trump has not stopped amplifying Putin’s assertion that Russia is innocent. And he tells his base—all those Fox News watchers—that the investigations are bunk and that the Deep State has manufactured this scandal to nail him. That is, Putin and the Kremlin are not the villains; the enemy is within.\\nAs Putin has tried to cloak Russian culpability, Trump has been an eager helpmate. In the run-up to the Helsinki meeting, Trump tweeted, “Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election!”\\nRussia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election! Where is the DNC Server, and why didn’t Shady James Comey and the now disgraced FBI agents take and closely examine it? Why isn’t Hillary/Russia being looked at? So many questions, so much corruption! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 28, 2018\\nAnd at a campaign rally a few days later, he declared that Putin was “fine.” Trump was legitimizing both Putin and his disinformation.\\nThen came the meltdown in Finland. Shortly after a 90-plus-minutes private meeting with Putin—no aides were present—Trump stood next to the Russian autocrat at a press conference, as Putin once more denied Russian intervention in the 2016 election. Trump then noted he had discussed with Putin “the issue of Russian interference in our elections,” without challenging Putin’s denial. He allowed the denial to stand. By saying nothing—just days after the Justice Department had indicted 12 Russian military officers for the criminal scheme—Trump was providing the Russian strongman a platform for continuing the cover-up.\\nIt got worse. Once again declaring there was “no collusion,” Trump attacked special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation as a “disaster” and “ridiculous.” When he was asked whether he believed the US intelligence community or Putin, first Trump criticized the FBI and prattled on about the phony issue of the DNC server, yet again purposefully distracting from the core elements of the Trump-Russia scandal. Next, he said, “My people came to me. [Director of National Intelligence] Dan Coates came to me and some others, they said they think it’s Russia. I have President Putin; he just said it’s not Russia. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.” Trump said he had “confidence” in both sides, meaning both Putin and his intelligence team. He continued: “I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.”\\nHere was Trump drawing an equivalence between his top intelligence advisers and Putin, the former KGB officer. It was a stunning moment. What more could Putin want? The president of the nation, which, according to its own intelligence and law enforcement agencies, was attacked by Russia, was giving Putin’s denial as much credence as Mueller’s indictments and the findings of various spy agencies, as well as the Republican-led intelligence committees of the House and Senate (which each confirmed the intelligence community’s assessment).\\nTrump was toiling (and trolling) hand-in-hand with Putin to advance Moscow’s deceit. And here’s a key question: was this performance jointly planned in advance? Both men said they did discuss the matter during their private tete-a-tete. It seems likely—in fact, highly probable—they talked about what they would say on this subject during the post-meeting press conference. (The public cannot be sure of this, because no one else, besides interpreters, attended the session, and no transcript has been released.) Yet the events of the past two years already indict Trump: he has repeatedly aided Putin’s attempt to escape responsibility for the attack.

His remarks, which indicated more troops for Afghanistan, came down like a ton of bricks on Pakistan’s continued patronage of terrorist groups. The speech was a lucid — and long-overdue — recognition: The United States’ 16-year war in Afghanistan has been floundering partly due to Pakistan’s dualism on terrorism, as well as Washington’s dualism on Pakistan.\\nTrump’s penchant for going madly off-script was contained by a teleprompter, and his speech was likely overseen by national security adviser H.R. McMaster. The remarks were a sharp shift from President Barack Obama’s tentative nudging of Pakistan in his 2009 Afghanistan address at West Point.\\nAdvertisement\\nIn that famous speech, Obama committed to a troop “surge” in Afghanistan and vowed to start to bring home American soldiers 18 months later. He did speak out against “safe havens” for terrorists in Pakistan. But unlike Trump’s, his tone was confused and conflicted — as if he couldn’t make up his mind on whether he wanted to support Pakistan or admonish it. Eventually, Obama chose to place the United States and Pakistan on the same side of the trenches in Afghanistan, fighting what he called a “common enemy.” Obama’s contradictory framework allowed Pakistan to continue to draw good-terrorist, bad-terrorist distinctions between extremist groups, with its army acting against the Taliban in areas such as Waziristan and Swat — while facilitating groups such as the Haqqani network in Afghanistan and the Lashkar-e-Taiba against India with impunity.\\nTrump has, at least verbally, abandoned Obama’s equivocation. “The next pillar of our new strategy is to change the approach in how to deal with Pakistan,” he announced, calling out the contradiction of paying “billions and billions of dollars” to Pakistan while it is “housing the very terrorists we are fighting.” Trump reminded the world that 20 U.S-designated terrorist organizations were operational in Pakistan and Afghanistan, making that the highest concentration of terrorist groups anywhere in the world. One of the groups, the Lashkar, which carried out the November 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, is presently talking about transforming into a political party. That impunity is the precise reason that the Trump administration’s shrapnel attack on Pakistan’s deep state is music to Afghanistan’s and India’s ears.\\nThe president used a figure for terror groups that mixes apples and oranges, making it too high. (Video: Meg Kelly/The Washington Post)\\n“Well, I think that Trump was wise to consider many different alternatives and arrive at one that reflects a longer-term view of the region (and its challenges),” Saad Mohseni, often described as Afghanistan’s first media mogul, told me. Mohseni, who launched the country’s first privately owned radio station and the groundbreaking Tolo TV, argues: “America has fought one-year wars, 16 times. Interestingly, Trump — not [former president George W.] Bush or Obama — has opted to adopt a longer-term approach to countering violent extremism. The likes of Mattis, McMaster and [Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph] Dunford know Afghanistan very well. More importantly, they have witnessed Pakistan’s meddling close-up. They will not be that easily fooled.”\\nAdvertisement\\nWith an estimated 10,000 U.S troops in Afghanistan and about twice as many contractors, the United States has been working on alternative supply lines that can reduce its logistical dependency on Pakistan. Now, Trump has taken it one step further, with a public pivot to India in his address. Beyond his snarky and childish swipe at how many billions of dollars India makes in trade with the United States, the president’s open invitation to India to get more economically involved in Afghanistan is guaranteed to make Pakistan even more apoplectic.\\nWhen Trump declared that “another critical part of the South Asia strategy for America is to further develop its strategic partnership with India, the world’s largest democracy and a key security and economic partner of the United States,” it was certainly an official acknowledgment of India as the dominant — and responsible — power in the region. India can be forgiven for chortling with satisfaction at the permanent erasure of the long-held hyphen between India and Pakistan. “The comments by President Trump on Pakistan are certainly welcome,” Vijay Chauthaiwale, the head of the ruling BJP’s foreign affairs department, told me. “He has rightly blamed Pakistan for being the home ground to terrorism that hits both India and Afghanistan. India is already involved in several development projects in Afghanistan. The appeal from POTUS in this regards will further strengthen USA-India-Afghanistan collaboration.”\\nIndia is Afghanistan’s largest regional donor — just last year, it pledged $1 billion in aid to Kabul. It has built more than 2,500 miles of road in Afghanistan, power projects and even the country’s new parliament building. No government in Delhi will take dikats from Washington on its Afghanistan policy. However, Trump’s address underscores the legitimacy of India’s strategic involvement in Afghanistan and presents an opportunity for even more direct engagement.\\nAdvertisement\\nSo what happens next? Pakistan has always looked for “strategic depth” in Afghanistan because of paranoia about India’s rising influence. Trump’s courting of Indian involvement may have two possible outcomes. An enraged security establishment in Pakistan could step up help to terrorist groups to retain control and use it as leverage with the Americans. In other words, brace for an escalation of terrorist violence in Afghanistan. Trump’s repudiation of Islamabad is also likely to push it deeper into the protective embrace of China, drawing the lines for another proxy battle of global superpowers.\\nIn India, no one is holding their breath. People want to see whether this is anything more than mere words. But the warning by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson of punitive action against Pakistan (this year the United States withheld $350 million in military aid) has raised hopes.\\nCan Trump be counted on to not unravel on Afghanistan? What if he tweets the exact opposite — or comes unhinged and has a change of heart? In this one case, Mohseni is putting his money on the president. He tells me what we see as Trump’s weakness may end being his strength when it comes to Afghanistan: “Obama’s mistake was to telegraph his intentions by disclosing his endgame to the likes of the Taliban and the ISI [Pakistan’s intelligence agency]. All they had to do was to wait him out. Trump’s biggest strength is his unpredictability. Folks in Islamabad and Rawalpindi are nervous; they are not sure how far he is willing to go.”\\nGiftOutline Gift Article'], 'https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/533042-pence-denounces-capitol-rioters-violence-never-wins': ['thehill.com', 'Pence denounces Capitol rioters: ‘Violence never wins’', 'Morgan Chalfant, Hour Ago, Hours Ago, Pm Et, Day Ago, Am Et, Days Ago', datetime.datetime(2021, 1, 7, 1, 37, 40), 'Vice President Pence late Wednesday evening denounced the violence at the U.S. Capitol in remarks on the Senate floor as lawmakers reconvened to resume the counting of Electoral College votes.\\n“To those who wreaked havoc in our Capitol today, you did not win.

Yet the two-volume document delivered Thursday, which revealed the existence of 12 secret inquiries spun off by the special counsel, provides a damning account of the president and aides who often struggled to save Trump from himself.\\n\"The president\\'s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests,\" the report concludes.\\nThe report details direct steps that the president took to quash the investigation, all falling short because Attorney General Jeff Sessions, White House counsel Don McGahn and White House adviser Corey Lewandowski refused to carry out his orders, including separate directives to curb the investigation and dismiss Mueller.\\nMueller’s office did not conclude that Trump\\'s actions were illegal but refused to clear him of wrongdoing, saying, \"If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.”\\nObstruction: President Trump tried to impede Russia inquiry but aides ignored his orders\\nConspiracy: Trump campaign was an eager beneficiary of Russian election help, Mueller report concludes\\nOn the central question of whether the Trump campaign engaged in a conspiracy with Russia, investigators found that a number of campaign aides and advisers engaged in contacts with people linked to the Russian regime even as the Kremlin carried out a wide-ranging effort to intervene in the election. The sophisticated intelligence program, which featured hacked documents and phony social media campaigns, was based on the Kremlin\\'s belief that it would gain from Trump winning the election, the report says.\\n“Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian Government in its election interference activities,” Mueller\\'s report concludes.\\nTrump, in a \"Game of Thrones\"-themed tweet, declared the report a vindication, saying, \"No collusion. No Obstruction. For the haters and the Radical Left Democrats – Game Over.\" His legal team, including Rudy Giuliani, characterized the report\\'s conclusions a \"total victory\" for Trump.\\nAttorney General William Barr, who briefed reporters before the report\\'s release, joined in a full-throated defense of the president, underscoring the report\\'s conclusion that no one associated with the Trump campaign \"conspired or coordinated with the Russian government.\"\\nDemocrats seized on the document\\'s more troubling findings, including its detailed accounting of multiple occasions on which Trump attempted to derail the investigation.\\n“Even in its incomplete form, the Mueller report outlines disturbing evidence that President Trump engaged in obstruction of justice and other misconduct,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said, adding that it would be up to \"Congress to hold the president accountable for his actions.\"\\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the account of Mueller\\'s obstruction inquiry marked Trump as \"dishonest, unethical and immoral.\"\\n\"Deeply alarming,\" Schiff said of the report.\\nAlthough Democrats have stepped back from pursuing impeachment proceedings against the president, Nadler said it remained a \"possibility.\"\\nWhile much of the public focus Thursday was trained on the president\\'s efforts at obstruction, Mueller\\'s investigation also yielded evidence that Trump campaign operatives expressed interest in pursuing questionable contacts with Russians amid the heated 2016 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Those same associates apparently failed to recognize that a deft intelligence operation directly tied to the Kremlin was actively manipulating the American electorate.\\nReport: Read special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s report into President Trump, Russian interference\\nThose suspicious interactions included contacts that involved national security adviser Michael Flynn, foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen and campaign chairman Paul Manafort, all of whom have been prosecuted by Mueller’s office.\\nSome of Trump\\'s aides lied to the special counsel and Congress about their interactions. “Those lies materially impaired the investigation of Russian election interference,” the report says. The campaign showed interest in WikiLeaks’ release of damaging documents about Clinton, the report says.\\nFor all of the information prosecutors gathered, the report casts doubt on whether they obtained “a complete picture” of activities during the Trump campaign, saying some campaign associates offered inadmissible information and deleted “relevant communications.” Some witnesses, the report says, communicated using phone applications that don’t retain data.\\nIn written responses to questions from prosecutors, Trump said more than 30 times that he did not \"recall\" or \"remember\" or have an \"independent recollection\" of events. Other answers, Mueller said, were \"incomplete or imprecise.\" Mueller expressed frustration with the president\\'s answers and considered whether to subpoena him but decided he had enough evidence from other sources to determine the credibility of Trump\\'s responses.\\n\"We viewed the written answers to be inadequate,\" the report says. \"But at that point our investigation had made significant progress and had produced substantial evidence for our report ... we determined that the substantial quantity of information we had obtained from other sources allowed us to draw relevant factual conclusions on intent and credibility.\"\\nMueller concluded there was insufficient evidence to support a conspiracy, yet the report details such a range of interactions between Trump associates and Russia that even the special counsel’s exoneration may not be enough to dissolve suspicion.\\n\"In sum, the investigation established multiple links between Trump campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government,\" according to the report. \"Those links included Russian offers of assistance to the campaign. In some instances, the campaign was receptive to the offer, while in other instances the campaign officials shied away. Ultimately, the investigation did not establish that the campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.\"\\nAmong the events Mueller’s team examined for possible obstruction was Trump’s angry reaction to Mueller\\'s appointment to lead the inquiry and Trump\\'s efforts to pressure then-Attorney General Sessions’ to resign or reverse his decision to recuse himself from managing the inquiry.\\n“Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my Presidency. I’m f---ed,” Trump said when he learned that Mueller had been appointed to investigate his campaign, according to notes kept by Sessions’ chief of staff, Jody Hunt.\\nThe confrontation prompted Sessions to offer his resignation, which Trump did not accept. Trump moved on to encourage then-White House counsel McGahn to remove Mueller. Trump, according to the report, called McGahn at home June 17, 2017, asserting that Mueller should be dismissed.\\nMcGahn did not carry out the direction, saying he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential “Saturday Night Massacre,” a reference to President Richard Nixon ordering his attorney general to fire the special investigator looking into the Watergate scandal.\\nIn the Trump administration, the president may have no more important ally than Barr, who succeeded Sessions after his ouster in November.\\nOn the question of obstruction, Barr said Trump\\'s actions stemmed from frustration with an investigation he thought constrained his presidency.\\n“The president took no act that deprived the special counsel of the documents and witnesses necessary to complete his investigation,” Barr said.\\nInvestigators examined several instances of possible obstruction by the president and whether they constituted criminal conduct. Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein “disagreed” with some legal theories advanced by Mueller but declined to elaborate.\\nThe attorney general said Trump faced “an unprecedented situation.\"\\nBarr acknowledged that the Justice Department gave Trump\\'s lawyers an advance look at Mueller\\'s report so the White House could decide whether to assert executive privilege. He said the president decided not to do so.\\nBefore the report\\'s release, political tensions boiled over. Some Democratic leaders called for Barr to put off his public briefing, asserting that he was providing political cover for the president before more damaging findings of the report were made public.\\nThe attorney general later offered some concession to Democrats, pledging to allow a limited number of lawmakers to view a less redacted version of the report at the Justice Department later this month.\\nTrump, who began Thursday morning with a pair of tweets denouncing the investigation as a hoax perpetrated by Democrats, ended the day with a celebratory declaration: \"Game Over.\"\\nThe report becomes public:Here are six things to look for.\\n\\'This is not justice\\': Democrats accuse Barr of protecting Trump in rollout of Mueller report\\n\\'I intend to fight\\': Congress prepares for a battle over secret grand jury evidence in Russia inquiry\\nMueller report: Investigation found no evidence Trump conspired with Russia, leaves obstruction question open\\nContributing: David Jackson'], 'http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/Politics-Voices/2016/1101/How-schools-can-bring-civility-to-politics': ['csmonitor.com', 'How schools can bring civility to politics', 'The Christian Science Monitor, John Gable', datetime.datetime(2016, 11, 1, 23, 16), 'With all the divisive rhetoric, sensationalist journalism, and inflamed passions during this election cycle, schools can be one of our saving graces.\\nBut only if teachers aren’t terrified about discussing elections.\\nTeachers recognize the need to discuss politics in order to prepare their students for their adult lives.

Jonathan Haidt explains the same phenomenon in his book, “The Righteous Mind, Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion.”\\nThat’s why we start with a lesson plan called “Relationships First.” Following a structure perfected by Living Room Conversations, teachers guide students through a process where they discover more about themselves and each other. They also learn some ground rules and best practices for listening and talking with each other.\\nNext, focus on the mind. We need to learn about the topic and be sure to see all sides of it.

Choose your plan ArrowRight Submitted to Congress on Thursday, the 448-page document alternates between jarring scenes of presidential scheming and dense legal analysis, and it marks the onset of a new phase of the Trump administration in which congressional Democrats must decide what, if anything, to do with Mueller’s evidence. The report suggests — though never explicitly states — that Congress, not the Justice Department, should assume the role of prosecutor when the person who may be prosecuted is the president.\\n“The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the President’s corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law,” Mueller’s team wrote.\\nAdvertisement\\nAttorney General William P. Barr is planning key redactions to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's report. (Video: Taylor Turner/The Washington Post)\\nTrump once feared Mueller could destroy his presidency, but the special counsel may instead define it. By releasing a thick catalogue of misconduct and mendacity that, if not criminal, is deeply unflattering, Mueller’s report may mean long-term political problems for a president seeking reelection next year.\\nStill, Trump’s electoral base has not been swayed by such stories in the past, and he has already claimed victory on the investigation’s bottom line: no conspiracy with Russia, no obstruction of justice.\\nSince Mueller ended his investigation last month, a central question facing the Justice Department has been why Mueller’s team did not reach a conclusion about whether the president obstructed justice. The issue was complicated, the report said, by two key factors — the fact that, under department practice, a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime, and that a president has a great deal of constitutional authority to give orders to other government employees.\\nAdvertisement\\nTrump submitted written answers to investigators. The special counsel’s office considered them “inadequate” but did not press for an interview with him because doing so would cause a “substantial delay,” the report says.\\nThe report said investigators felt they had “sufficient evidence to understand relevant events and to make certain assessments without the President’s testimony.”\\nTrump’s legal team declared Mueller’s report “a total victory” for the president. It “underscores what we have argued from the very beginning — there was no collusion — there was no obstruction,” they said.\\nIn their statement, Trump’s lawyers also attacked former leaders at the FBI for opening “a biased, political attack against the President — turning one of our foundational legal standards on its head.”\\nTrump said little publicly about the report’s release. At an event Thursday, he indicated he was having a “good day,” adding that “this should never happen to another president again, this hoax.” Ahead of the report’s release, the president lobbed a familiar attack on the investigation. “PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!” he tweeted. “The Greatest Political Hoax of all time! Crimes were committed by Crooked, Dirty Cops and DNC/The Democrats.”\\nAdvertisement\\nIf Mueller’s report was a victory for the president, it was an ugly one. Investigators paint a portrait of a president who believes the Justice Department and the FBI should answer to his orders, even when it comes to criminal investigations.\\nDuring a meeting in which the president complained about then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation, Trump insisted that past attorneys general had been more obedient to their presidents, referring to President John F. Kennedy and his brother, Robert, as well as the Obama administration.\\n“You’re telling me that Bobby and Jack didn’t talk about investigations? Or Obama didn’t tell Eric Holder who to investigate?” Trump told senior White House staffers Stephen K. Bannon and Donald McGahn, according to the report.\\nAdvertisement\\n“Bannon recalled that the President was as mad as Bannon had ever seen him and that he screamed at McGahn about how weak Sessions was,” the report said.\\nRepeatedly, it appears Trump may have been saved from more serious legal jeopardy because his own staffers refused to carry out orders they thought were problematic or potentially illegal.\\nFor instance, in the early days of the administration, when the president was facing growing questions concerning then-national security adviser Michael Flynn’s conversations about sanctions with a Russian ambassador, the president ordered another aide, K.T. McFarland, to write an email saying the president did not direct those conversations. She decided not to do so, unsure if that was true and fearing it might be improper.\\n“Some evidence suggests that the President knew about the existence and content of Flynn’s calls when they occurred, but the evidence is inconclusive and could not be relied upon to establish the President’s knowledge,’ ” the report said.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe report also recounts a remarkable moment in May 2017 when Sessions told Trump that Mueller had just been appointed special counsel. Trump slumped back in his chair, according to notes from Jody Hunt, Sessions’s then-chief of staff. “Oh my God, this is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I’m fucked,” Trump said. The president further laid into Sessions for his recusal, saying Sessions had let him down.\\n“Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins your presidency,” Trump said, according to Hunt’s notes. “It takes years and years and I won’t be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.”\\nThe special counsel’s report on possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russians to interfere in the 2016 election is extremely detailed with only modest redactions — painting a starkly different picture for Trump than Attorney General William P. Barr has offered, and revealing new details about interactions between Russians and Trump associates.\\nAdvertisement\\nMueller’s team wrote that though their investigation “did not establish that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,” that assertion was informed by the fact that coordination requires more than two parties “taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other’s actions or interests.”\\nAnd Mueller made it clear: Russia wanted to help the Trump campaign, and the Trump campaign was willing to take it.\\n“Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,” Mueller’s team wrote.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe report detailed a timeline of contacts between the Trump campaign and those with Russian ties — much of it already known, but some of it new.\\nFor example, Mueller’s team asserted that in August 2016, Konstantin Kilimnik, whom the FBI has assessed as having ties to Russian intelligence, met with Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign chairman, “to deliver in person a peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel’s Office was a ‘backdoor’ way for Russia to control part of eastern Ukraine.”\\nThe special counsel wrote that both men believed the plan would require candidate Trump’s “assent to succeed (were he elected President).”\\n“They also discussed the status of the Trump Campaign and Manafort’s strategy for winning Democratic votes in Midwestern states,” the special counsel wrote. “Months before that meeting, Manafort had caused internal polling data to be shared with Kilimnik, and the sharing continued for some period of time after their August meeting.”\\nAdvertisement\\nMueller’s report suggests his obstruction-of-justice investigation was heavily informed by an opinion from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) that says a sitting president cannot be indicted — a conclusion Mueller’s team accepted.\\n“And apart from OLC’s constitutional view, we recognized that a federal criminal accusation against a sitting President would place burdens on the President’s capacity to govern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct,” Mueller’s team wrote.\\nThat decision, though, seemed to leave investigators in a strange spot. Mueller’s team wrote that they “determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes.” They seemed to shy from producing even an internal document that alleged the president had done something wrong — deciding, essentially, that they wouldn’t decide.\\n“Although a prosecutor’s internal report would not represent a formal public accusation akin to an indictment, the possibility of the report’s public disclosure and the absence of a neutral adjudicatory forum to review its findings counseled against determining ‘that the person’s conduct constitutes a federal offense.’ ”\\nBarr said during a news conference Thursday that Justice Department officials asked Mueller “about the OLC opinion and whether or not he was taking the position that he would have found a crime but for the existence of the OLC opinion.”\\n“He made it very clear, several times, that he was not taking a position — he was not saying but for the OLC opinion he would have found a crime,” Barr said.\\nMueller did not attend the news conference.\\nBarr addressed the media before releasing the report. He made repeated references to “collusion,” echoing language the president has stressed even though it is not a relevant legal term.\\nBarr also described how the nation’s top law enforcement officials wrestled with investigating Trump for possible obstruction of justice. He and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein “disagreed with some of the special counsel’s legal theories and felt that some of the episodes did not amount to obstruction as a matter of law” but that they accepted the special counsel’s “legal framework” as they analyzed the case, Barr said.\\nIt was the first official acknowledgment of differing views inside the Justice Department about how to investigate the president.\\nBarr also spoke about the president’s state of mind as Trump responded to the unfolding investigation. “As the Special Counsel’s report acknowledges, there is substantial evidence to show that the president was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks,” he said.\\nThe report also said there was a critical distinction to be drawn when analyzing Trump’s conduct — what he did before and what he did after The Washington Post reported in June 2017 that he was under investigation for potential obstruction of justice.\\n“That awareness marked a significant change in the President’s conduct and the start of a second phase of action,” Mueller’s team wrote in their report. “The president launched public attacks on the investigation and individuals involved in it who could possess evidence adverse to the President, while in private, the President engaged in a series of targeted efforts to control the investigation.”\\nMueller’s team said those efforts included attempting to remove Mueller as special counsel, pressuring Sessions to unrecuse himself from the investigation, and using “public forums to attack potential witnesses who might offer adverse information and to praise witnesses who declined to cooperate with the government.”\\nThe Mueller report is considered so politically explosive that even the Justice Department’s rollout plan sparked a firestorm, with Democrats suggesting that the attorney general was trying to improperly color Mueller’s findings before the public could read them.\\nBarr is preparing to testify to Congress about the report next month, and Democrats are moving to secure Mueller’s testimony soon after. The attorney general also notified Congress after the report’s release that a small number of senior members of each party would get a chance to review a less-redacted version of the document next week.\\nDemocrats, who have vowed to fight to get the entire report without redactions, as well as the underlying investigative documents, immediately panned the offer, calling it a non-starter.\\nGreg Miller, Spencer S.

Discarded food cans litter the area, and a tangle of wire runs through the middle of it.\\nWelcome to the other US-Mexican border – the one without a barrier.\\nThe border here looks easy enough for anyone to cross. Donald Trump wants to change that. To address the problem, the Republican presidential candidate makes a bold pledge. “We will build a great wall along the southern border,” he says. “And Mexico will pay for the wall.”\\nAs if on cue, the crowds at his rallies respond with a now familiar mantra: “Build that wall.... Build that wall.... Build that wall....”\\nIn a presidential election campaign unlike any in US history, Trump’s Wall looms large. At this point it is merely a proposal, yet the very idea of it has split the American public, offended Mexico, alienated American Latinos, and drawn a razor-sharp contrast between Mr. Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on the thorny issue of illegal immigration.\\nIn a larger sense, Trump’s Wall is an ultimatum for the hemisphere and perhaps for the world – that it is time for the most powerful and richest country on earth to turn its generosity inward.\\n“There is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well-being of the American people,” Trump says.\\n“Under a Trump administration, it’s called America first.”\\nBut beneath all the rhetoric on both sides of the issue, practical questions loom: Could a wall actually be built? How much would it cost?

Peter, Correspondent\\nAnn Hermes/The Christian Science Monitor Federal district Judge Robert C. Brack stands outside the United States Federal Courthouse on July 17, 2014 in Las Cruces, New Mexico. The number of defendants Judge Brack sentences is among the highest in the nation due to the volume of cases he oversees dealing with illegal immigrants reentering the United States.\\nLAS CRUCES, N.M. — Less than an hour into one of his regular morning dockets, federal district Judge Robert Brack has already sentenced 14 felons, or roughly one-sixth the number of people the average federal judge sentences in an entire year. The 15th defendant of the morning, Jamie Peña-Flores, stands before the judge shackled at the ankles, wrists, and waist.\\n“This is a tragic case,” says the man’s lawyer. Mr. Peña-Flores, a Mexican national, has spent most of his life in the United States working as a certified diesel mechanic and welder. He was most recently living in Wyoming, where he was making $28 per hour. His three children are American citizens and his wife has been diagnosed with cancer. Until this moment in court, the defendant had a clean criminal record, except for one incident of driving under the influence, for which he’d already served jail time.\\nPeña-Flores, however, entered the country illegally. For at least the second time in his life, authorities caught him trying to cross from Mexico, where he had recently returned for a visit, into the US, an infraction that can be prosecuted as a felony and is part of a burgeoning American strategy to reduce illegal immigration.\\n• • •\\nENGAGE: Living Room Conversations and AllSides.com\\n• • •\\nQUIZZES: Test your knowledge on US citizenship\\n1.

Joe Biden is the latest prominent politician to navigate this tricky terrain. (AP Photo/Nick Wass, File)\\nNEW YORK (AP) — Facing intense scrutiny from President Donald Trump and his Republican allies, Hunter Biden said Sunday he will step down from the board of directors of a Chinese-backed private equity firm at the end of the month as part of a pledge not to work on behalf of any foreign-owned companies should his father win the presidency.\\nBiden, the 49-year-old son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, revealed his plan in an internet post written by his attorney, George Mesires, who outlined a defense of the younger Biden’s work in Ukraine and China, which has emerged as one of Trump’s chief lines of attack against Hunter’s father despite no proof of impropriety.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n“Hunter makes the following commitment: Under a Biden Administration, Hunter will readily comply with any and all guidelines or standards a President Biden may issue to address purported conflicts of interest, or the appearance of such conflicts, including any restrictions related to overseas business interests. In any event, Hunter will agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign owned companies,” Mesires wrote.\\nHe continued: “He will continue to keep his father personally uninvolved in his business affairs, while availing himself as necessary and appropriate to the Office of the White House Counsel to help inform his application of the Biden Administration’s guidelines or standards to his business decision-making.”\\nJoe Biden, speaking to reporters after a union forum in suburban Des Moines, Iowa, said his son did not discuss that decision with him before posting the statement.\\n“No one has asserted my son did a single thing wrong,” Biden added, pounding his finger into the podium, “except a lying president.”\\nAnd Biden promised to bar his family members from occupying any office within the White House and said they won’t “sit in meetings as if they are a Cabinet member.” That was a jab at Trump, who taps daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, as advisers. Biden did not say if his pledge meant that Jill Biden, his wife, would not get the office traditionally assigned to first ladies, should he win.\\nHe further vowed that no one in his family will have “any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or foreign country.”\\nHunter Biden’s work overseas sits at the center of the House impeachment inquiry into Trump, who has admitted to asking foreign powers to investigate Hunter Biden’s business dealings abroad.\\nThe White House released a rough transcript of a call in which Trump asks Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to probe Biden’s family and Ukraine’s role in the 2016 election that put Trump in office. Trump has also encouraged China to dig into Hunter Biden’s work in that country, asserting without evidence that earned $1.5 billion from a “sweetheart” business deal there.\\nThe president’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, is also under increasing scrutiny for his efforts to dig into Hunter Biden’s business background. Late last week, two businessmen involved in Giuliani’s efforts to investigate Hunter Biden’s dealings in Ukraine were charged with federal campaign finance violations.\\nStill, Republicans reacted to news of Hunter Biden’s decision to step away from the Chinese-backed BHR Equity Investment Fund Management Co. with deep skepticism.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n“I think this is just another way to save a flailing campaign that’s going down,” Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” ″He knows he’s in trouble and this is just another way to try and detract attention\\nOn the same show, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Hunter Biden “should have done this quite a while ago.”\\nMesires noted repeatedly that there is no evidence of wrongdoing against Hunter Biden, despite intensifying attacks from Trump before the 2020 election.\\n“Despite extensive scrutiny, at no time has any law enforcement agency, either domestic or foreign, alleged that Hunter engaged in wrongdoing at any point during his five-year term,” Mesires said in his Sunday post of Biden’s experience in Ukraine.\\nThe attorney wrote that Hunter Biden worked as an unpaid board member for BHR Equity Investment Fund Management Co. “based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets.”\\n“To date, Hunter has not received any compensation for being on BHR’s board of directors,” Mesires said. “He has not received any return on his investment; there have been no distributions to BHR shareholders since Hunter obtained his equity interest.”\\nOne of Biden’s Democratic presidential rivals praised the move, noting that Trump’s children are openly trading on his name in business deals around the world while Trump occupies the Oval Office.\\n“I think it demonstrates the difference in standards relative to the White House,” said Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.\\n“I mean, here you have Hunter Biden stepping down from a position in order to make sure, even though there’s been no accusation of wrongdoing — doing something just to make sure there’s not even the appearance of a conflict of interests, while, in the White House, the president of the United States is a walking conflict of interest,” he said.'], 'https://www.salon.com/2020/01/27/follow-the-money-on-impeachment-trump-bought-off-the-jury--and-hints-at-bigger-tax-cuts/': ['salon.com', 'Follow the money on impeachment: Trump bought off the jury - and hints at bigger tax cuts', '', datetime.datetime(2020, 1, 27, 11, 0, 1), 'It\\'s long been obvious that Republican senators have little interest in serving as impartial jurors in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. While there is a raft of motivations for such historic perfidy — with several GOP senators politically benefiting from some of the same corrupting influences — one under-examined, non-Russian reason is personal greed.\\nA new report reveals that the 2017 GOP tax law was rife with monumental self-dealing by rich GOP lawmakers who have since benefited bigly. According to a Center for Public Integrity analysis, several Republican members of Congress directly cashed in on the multibillion-dollar windfall from the corporate tax cuts the GOP pushed through on a party-line vote. With the lowest effective tax rate in the last 40 years, America\\'s largest corporations proceeded to pour $1 trillion not into increased wages for workers but buybacks of their own stocks, causing stock prices to soar. Coincidentally, many Republican lawmakers who voted for the largest tax cut signed into law by Trump personally owned some of the same stocks whose values significantly increased as a result.\\nAt least seven Republican senators owned stocks in companies that spent billions on buybacks, resulting in great personal profit, according to the Center for Public Integrity. The report came on the same day that former New York Rep. Chris Collins, who was the first sitting GOP congressman to support Trump\\'s 2016 presidential campaign, was sentenced to 26 months in prison for insider trading.\\nIt is no wonder why Republicans insisted on ramming through incredibly unpopular tax cuts for American corporations that were already making near-record profits, even at the risk of losing control of the House of Representatives. Of course, billionaires and corporations that reaped millions of dollars from the GOP tax cuts pumped some of that windfall into Republican campaigns, allowing Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to retain control of the Senate. With that, Trump\\'s fate in a Senate impeachment trial was all but sealed.\\nWhile the report is a less than shocking look into the kleptocratic ways of the modern GOP, it shows that the transactional core of the 2017 tax cuts has ramifications far beyond the $1.8 trillion increase in the national debt. Republican senators in purple states, like Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and David Perdue of Georgia, have personally reaped hundreds of millions from the tax law and are repaying the president by serving as his impeachment propaganda machine rather than impartial jurors — even as half of registered voters and a majority of independents in a Fox News poll released on Sunday said the Senate should convict Trump.\\nNow, in addition to running defense for Trump, McConnell\\'s repeating Trump\\'s empty promises of a middle-class tax cut in an election year.\\n\"We\\'re talking a fairly substantial … middle-class tax cut that\\'ll be subject to taking back the House and obviously keeping the Senate and keeping the White House,\" Trump told the Wall Street Journal during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week. He promised a plan would be revealed in 90 days.\\nBefore the 2018 midterms, Trump actually admitted that his tax bill was never aimed at cutting middle-class taxes, promising to actually deliver in 2019. \"We\\'re putting in a resolution some time in the next week and a half to two weeks [and] we\\'re giving a middle-income tax reduction of about 10 percent,\" Trump told reporters at the time.\\nThe first Republican rule of \"middle-class tax cuts\" is to speak about them but never actually pass them. They\\'ve been pulling the same bait-and-switch since at least 1980. But while they were cutting taxes for the rich and corporations, the GOP left in place the income taxes a majority of seniors pay on their Social Security income. Now they are again touting cuts to Medicare and Social Security to cover the payoff they gave to themselves.\\n\"The president directed me to produce what we\\'re calling tax cuts 2.0,\" senior White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow explained last week. \"It will be published sometime during the campaign, as a message for future Trump economic growth policies, [with] particular emphasis on the middle class, in his second term. ... We are looking at a variety of tax cuts, sometimes making permanent some existing tax cuts, some existing corporate tax cuts.\"\\nThat last part gives the game away.

So, if anything, maybe that statement wasn’t tough enough.”\\n[6 questions about North Korea’s quest for nuclear weapons]\\nAs the war of words continued for a third day, Trump made no reference to an undercurrent of concern among some within his administration about his rhetoric, or to the widespread nervousness and disapproval expressed by U.S. allies. The exchanges, including a North Korean threat to Guam, have rattled a world wondering what will be next.\\n(Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post)\\nJust this past weekend, the administration was congratulating itself for orchestrating a unanimous U.N. Security Council vote to sharply increase sanctions against Pyongyang, describing steady diplomatic and economic pressure as the keystone of its strategy.\\nInstead, Trump said Thursday that the administration is now examining its entire military posture in Asia and that “we are preparing for many different alternative events.”\\nHe said that he had already decided to increase the “antimissile” budget “by many billions of dollars, because of North Korea and other reasons.”\\nLast spring, the United States installed a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, anti-ballistic-missile system in South Korea.\\nTrump’s latest comments on the North Korea crisis came in remarks to reporters before and after a national security briefing at his private golf club here, where he is on a working vacation. Seated around a table with the president were Vice President Pence, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster and homeland security adviser Tom Bossert. Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and several other aides were also in the room.\\nThe threat to Guam, made after his initial “fire and fury” remarks, was “a whole new ballgame,” Trump said. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was “not getting away with it,” he said, adding, “He’s not going to be saying those things, and he’s certainly not going to be doing those things.”\\n“He does something in Guam, it will be an event the likes of which nobody’s seen before, what will happen in North Korea,” he said. “It’s not a dare. It’s a statement.” Kim, Trump said, was “not going to go around threatening Guam and he’s not going to threaten the United States and he’s not going to threaten Japan and he’s not going to threaten South Korea.”\\nView Graphic North Korea has launched 18 missile tests in 2017, and 13 were successful.\\nTrump said that the Security Council vote was gratifying and that he remained open to negotiating with Pyongyang. But, he said, talks over the years under previous administrations had done little to halt the country’s nuclear program. “What they’ve been doing, what they’ve been getting away with, is a tragedy, and it can’t be allowed,” he said.\\nIn Twitter comments Wednesday that were clearly directed at North Korea, Trump also warned that the U.S. nuclear arsenal was “now far stronger and more powerful than ever before.” It would remain the world’s strongest, he said Thursday, until the world decides to get rid of nuclear weapons altogether.\\n“Nuclear to me, number one, I would like to de-nuke the world,” he said. “I know that President Obama said global warming is the biggest threat. I totally disagree.” But until denuclearization happens, Trump said, “nobody, including North Korea, is going to be threatening us with anything.”\\nThursday’s security briefing and the president’s statements came after two days of mixed messages from the administration.\\nOn Tuesday, Trump delivered an unusually bellicose threat to North Korea, warning that further provocations from Pyongyang “will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.” His language was improvised and had not been reviewed by his national security advisers or political aides.\\nThe North Koreans effectively laughed off his remarks, calling them a “load of nonsense” and outlining their plans to fire missiles into the waters off Guam, a strategically located Pacific island and home to U.S. military bases.\\nSenior administration officials then sought to calm anxious world leaders as well as Americans. But statements from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and senior White House officials, including adviser Sebastian Gorka, varied widely in tone and to some extent in substance, ranging from sober and reassuring (Tillerson) to forceful yet measured (Mattis) to bellicose in the style of the president (Gorka).\\nMattis, in a statement released Wednesday by the Pentagon, said that “while our State Department is making every effort to resolve this global threat through diplomatic means,” allied militaries “now possess the most precise, rehearsed and robust defensive and offensive capabilities on Earth.”\\nLater Wednesday, in comments not released by the Pentagon until Thursday, Mattis told a pool of reporters traveling with him to the West Coast, where he planned to visit technology companies, that “of course there’s a military option.” But “we want to use diplomacy. That’s where we’ve been, that’s where we are right now, and that’s where we hope to remain.”\\nAsked about Trump’s “fire and fury” comments, Mattis said: “The rhetoric is up to the president. This is my rhetoric.”\\nAfter Trump’s remarks Thursday, Mattis, in Silicon Valley, paused before commenting. “My portfolio, my mission, my responsibility is to have military options if you need it,” he said. “However, right now you can see . . . the American effort is diplomatically led, has diplomatic traction and is gaining diplomatic results. And I want to stay right there right now. The tragedy of war is well enough known. It does not need another characterization beyond the fact that it would be catastrophic.”\\nGorka was asked Thursday by BBC News about the apparent divergence between Trump and his senior Cabinet advisers. “You should listen to the president,” he said, adding that it was “simply nonsensical” that Tillerson would deal with “military matters.”\\n“We are not giving in to nuclear blackmail any longer,” Gorka said. Asked about critics such as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who called Trump’s rhetoric provocative, he replied that “there is only one person in this great country that controls our nuclear arsenal, and it’s not John McCain.”\\nAt the State Department on Thursday, spokeswoman Heather Nauert responded sharply to Gorka’s comments on Tillerson: “I can say that I speak for Secretary Tillerson and this building. . . . Our secretary has been very clear, as has been Secretary Mattis, that our diplomatic and military means are both strong and capable.”\\nAsked whether Tillerson’s push for diplomacy was being heeded elsewhere in the administration, Nauert said: “He’s a Cabinet secretary. He’s fourth in line to the presidency. He carries a big stick.”\\nTillerson, who returned Wednesday from a lengthy Asian trip on which he sought to build support for full implementation of the new sanctions, made no public appearance.\\nMeanwhile, the Associated Press reported that Kuwait’s government said it would continue to grant visas to North Korean laborers, whose wages allegedly aid the Pyongyang government, despite a sanctions provision prohibiting their employment.\\nThe AP quoted a Kuwaiti government statement saying “there are no plans to expel” some 6,000 North Korean laborers working there.\\nNauert said the statement had been “brought to our attention” and that the administration was in “close contact” with the Kuwaitis. “We understand that the government of Kuwait will be issuing a [new] statement imminently,” she said.\\nAbout an hour later, the Kuwait News Agency posted a statement from the country’s foreign ministry saying that “pursuant to the UN Security Council resolution on economic sanctions on North Korea, the State of Kuwait no longer issues entry visas for North Korean workers or licenses for commercial activities and halted direct flights from the country.”\\nDeYoung reported from Washington.\\nRead more:\\nA nuclear-armed North Korea could make smaller disputes with Pyongyang much more dangerous\\nIf Trump wants a nuclear attack against North Korea, his military advisers have few other options\\nKim Jong Un wants to stay in power — and that is an argument against nuclear war'], 'https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-reason-leaders-hid-january-6-tapes': ['foxcom', 'TUCKER CARLSON: We knew there was a reason leaders hid the January 6 tapes', 'Tucker Carlson, Tucker Carlson Currently Serves As The Host Of Fox News Channel S, Fnc, Tucker Carlson Tonight, Weekdays Et .

Liz Cheney\\'s tweet is still on Twitter tonight. \"Officer Sicknick was killed defending our Capitol from the violent mob on January 6.\" No correction. Anderson Cooper of CNN still has not apologized \"Officer Brian Sicknick died after being hit the head with a fire extinguisher during the fight,\" he told us. Those are lies. Why not just admit it and move on? They won\\'t.\\nIn fact, this week, the White House trotted out both the press secretary and Joe Biden\\'s attorney general, the attorney general of the United States, to claim not just that Brian Sicknick was actually murdered by Republicans at the Capitol, but that other officers were murdered, too. It\\'s almost beyond belief. Watch this.\\nKARINE JEAN-PIERRE: The wide range of bipartisan lawmakers, you heard them all yesterday, you guys reported on it, who have condemned this false depiction of the unprecedented violent attack on upon our Constitution and the rule of law, which cost police officers their lives.\\nMERRICK GARLAND: It was a violent attack on a fundamental tenet of American democracy, that power is peacefully transferred from one administration to another. Over 100 officers were assaulted on that day. Five officers died.\\n\"Five officers died on that day.\" Now, that\\'s just not some guy on Twitter. That\\'s the attorney general of the United States. That\\'s a man whose honesty is central to his job. If you had a choice between IQ and integrity in an attorney general, of course you go with integrity because it\\'s essential, but Joe Biden\\'s attorney general, Merrick Garland, is a liar. He just lied about something that is provably false. Who are these five officers who were \"killed that day\"?\\nNotice he didn\\'t tell you. No one ever tells you. No one ever shows you their autopsies. They don\\'t want any detail. They just want the slogan. Now they\\'re counting Brian Sicknick. That\\'s a lie. But who are the other four? Well, those are four officers who killed themselves after January 6, in some cases long after January 6. But their suicides, we know for a fact, were the result of the Republican mob at the Capitol. It\\'s just false, and it\\'s not some esoteric fact.\\nHOUSE REPUBLICANS PLANNING TO VISIT JAN. 6 DEFENDANTS IN DC JAIL\\nThat fact is available to anyone who has internet access. No police officers died that day on January 6, none, not one. Some were assaulted. That is true and their assaults are indefensible. How many were assaulted? Garland said over 100. The Government Accountability Office says the number is 114, and we\\'re just going to roll with that. We don\\'t know if it\\'s true, but we\\'ll take it at face value and that is bad. We are opposed to assaulting police officers in any context. We said that on January 6, 2021. We\\'ll say it again. We\\'re against that.\\nBut is January 6 the worst assault on the U.S. government since the Civil War? That\\'s insane. It\\'s not even close. How about March of 1954, when Puerto Rican separatists shot five congressmen in the Capitol building – five members of Congress shot in the building. It\\'s all bad, but the worst since the Civil War? You’re just a flat-out liar if you\\'re saying that.\\nMore recently, this is an event we all remember, Antifa descended on Washington, D.C to force the sitting president from office. But it was Trump, so that\\'s cool, and why they were there. They set a historic Christian church on fire, St. John’s in Lafayette Square. Do you remember that? You should, because it happened Labor Day weekend less than three years ago and when that happened, the left-wing mayor of Washington, D.C. refused to allow her police department, the MPD, to assist Secret Service agents while they were under siege and getting beaten. No, she made her cops stand back and watch it happen, and they were very upset about it at the time. You may have forgotten that. Here\\'s what it looks like.\\nREPORTER: I believe there are several fires raging now down this street and this is what you hate to see. There are people throwing fireworks and who knows what else. They just set fire to St. John\\'s Church.\\nBurning a church across from the White House. Those are the George Floyd riots. What was the toll there? Now, we\\'re not going to guess. We\\'re going to go again right to the government, according to a recently released jail report last month. During those attacks, the 2020 attack on the White House by left wing mobs, \"Federal Protective Services, the Secret Service and the Park Police reported that at least 180 officers were injured during the demonstrations, including concussions, lacerations, exposure to chemical gas and severe burning.\"\\nSo, while stipulating that all riots are bad because precision matters, facts matter, the truth matters, here\\'s the truth: More cops were injured by Kamala Harris\\'s favorite mob, BLM, at the White House than were injured by Trump voters at the Capitol on January 6, a lot more. So, again, to be clear, both events are bad, but here\\'s the key. We only remember one of them. Why? Because the people in charge of history are liars - liars, And lying is bad and on a national scale, it\\'s deadly. It\\'s corrosive of everything that is good in the country, including trust and your grasp on reality itself and that\\'s what they try to make.\\nMILITARY VET CONVICTED OF STORMING THE US CAPITOL\\nYou lie. Men can become women. Climate change is an existential threat, or whatever the lie is they\\'re making you tell, they don\\'t believe it. They know you don\\'t believe it, but by forcing you to repeatedly degrade and control you, they make you less of a person. They also hurt individuals. We told you Monday about Navy veteran Jacob Chansley. He was tried by the media, convicted of being a domestic terrorist and sentenced to four years in prison. What exactly was Jacob Chansley\\'s crime? Well, no one\\'s ever very precise about that. Here\\'s what the media told you.\\nABC: It was in his horned helmet, fur pelts and face paint, Jacob Chansley became known as the QAnon shaman, but prosecutors called him the most prominent symbol of a violent insurrection.\\nCNN: He\\'s been in jail since January and he\\'s trying to get out, but prosecutors say he is still too dangerous to release.\\nMSNBC: Make no mistake, Chansley is a stone-cold thug.\\nCBS: Oh, he kept saying, you know, \"I\\'m not violent, I\\'m peaceful, I\\'m a shaman,\" but then you put those images, what you were just talking about, you put those images together, and that isn\\'t an image of, you know, of peace. This is the new face of extremism.\\n\"It\\'s the new face of extremism. Jacob Chansley is the new face of extreme extremism. He\\'s a stone-cold thug. Prosecutors say he is too dangerous to release.\" And most people believe that because why wouldn\\'t they? They were told it and there was no evidence to the contrary and now there is evidence to the contrary. We brought it here, Monday. The video that we reviewed at great length over three weeks showed with precision what Jacob Chansley actually did inside the Capitol and here\\'s what it looks like once again.\\nTUCKER CARLSON: Here\\'s video of Chansley in the Senate chamber. Capitol police officers take him to multiple entrances and even try to open locked doors for him. We counted at least nine officers who were within touching distance of unarmed Jacob Chansley. Not one of them even tried to slow him down. Chansley understood that Capitol Police were his allies. Video shows him giving thanks for them in a prayer on the floor of the Senate. Watch.\\nELON MUSK TORCHES HOUSE JAN. 6 COMMITTEE FOR \\'MISLEADING THE PUBLIC,\\' WITHHOLDING EVIDENCE: \\'DEEPLY WRONG\\'\\nJACOB CHANSLEY, \"QANON SHAMAN\": Thank you, Heavenly Father for taking the inspiration needed to these police officers to let us into the building.\\nContrast the reality of what Jacob Chansley did in the Capitol building on January 6, the indisputable facts recorded on video, some of which has never before been seen, with the depiction of Jacob Chansley that you\\'ve seen in the media for more than two years. He\\'s a terrorist, they said, he should be killed.\\nSTEVE SCHMIDT: Shoot him. Shoot him. Like is it you burst into the United States, if he was dressed like bin Laden, would they have shot him?\\nCARLSON: \"Shoot him, Shoot him.\" It makes you wonder who are the violent extremists here? So, as you saw and again, details matter because this is a man, this is an American citizen, a Navy veteran. This is a human being and so what he actually did should be of deep concern to every American because he\\'s in jail tonight. What Jacob Chansley actually did was wander peacefully through the Capitol, shepherded by Capitol police officers who literally opened doors for him. When one was locked, they went to another.\\nDozens of officers stood and watched him. All of them had guns. Jacob Chansley did not. They never told Jacob Chansley to get out. The head of the Capitol Police today said we he was just trying to calm the situation. It was already calm. He was the only protester in the frame. They could have let him outside. They didn\\'t. They helped him. We\\'re not going to speculate as to why. We don\\'t know why. All we know is what we see on the tape and no one disputes it. We didn\\'t cherry-pick it. We didn\\'t make it up.\\nOnce inside the Senate chamber, as we told you, Chansley said a prayer, thanking God for the kindness of Capitol Hill police and good for him. They were kind. This was not a domestic terrorist and that matters, but what matters even more is the videos that we showed you after 26 months were not shown to Jacob Chansley\\'s attorneys. That\\'s a violation of the Constitution. and he\\'s in jail because of it, because the liars on the January 6 Committee and the prosecutors who did their bidding and that means Bennie Thompson and that means Adam Schiff. It means Liz Cheney. These people have this man\\'s life on their hands.\\nKEVIN MCCARTHY AND HAKEEM JEFFRIES DEMAND ANSWERS ON \\'SIGNIFICANT\\' DATA BREACH AFFECTING MEMBERS AND STAFF\\nThey helped withhold these videos from Jacob Chansley\\'s attorneys and that means the judge who sentenced Jacob Chansley, Royce Lamberth, never saw them either and therefore...Judge Lamberth was able to say that what Chansley did was \"horrific.\" He apparently had no idea that Chansley was wandering around with the cops, walking through doors they opened and saying prayers for them. We\\'re quoting: \"you made yourself the center of the riot,\" said the judge. Really? He accused Chansley of \"obstructing the functioning of government.\"\\nThat\\'s not at all what was happening. He was ambling through the Capitol, flanked at all times, by armed cops were directing his movement. Meanwhile, prosecutors of the DOJ, the real villains here, falsely, they lied in court and said that Chansley was \"leading the charge into the Capitol on January 6.\" They said he was, \"the flag bearer for the mob,\" apparently because he had a flag. He was alone and of course, the media picked up on this and amplified it as the DOJ intended.\\nFortune Magazine disgraced itself by comparing the man you just saw to ISIS. They said Chansley had \"the zeal to possibly kidnap or kill officials.\" These aren\\'t just lies. These are lies that destroyed a man. So, no matter who you voted for in the last election, you could probably agree that sending someone to prison for four years on the basis of fabricated evidence is the most serious threat to civil liberties we could possibly face.\\nAnd yet, here\\'s the thing: Leaders in both parties, the party that Chansley voted against and the party he voted for, have said nothing, not one word about the implications of this videotape, the implications not just for Chansley, but for our Constitution and our country going forward.\\nInstead, oh, how dare you show this? What is clearly exculpatory evidence! Again, it\\'s not just Chuck Schumer, it\\'s Republican senators Kevin Cramer, Mike Rounds, Chuck Grassley, John Thune, Lindsey Graham, of course, Congressman Dan Crenshaw, needless to say, Kelly Armstrong, all went after us. We\\'re not whining about that. We don\\'t care, actually, but it just tells you everything about the way things actually work. They\\'re not loyal to their voters. They are loyal to each other, and they\\'re willing to lie, really lie and crush people.

When you see police barricades breached, when you see police officers assaulted, all of that, or you had to be in close proximity to it, if you were just a tourist, you should have probably lined up at the visitor center and came in on an orderly basis. I just don\\'t think it\\'s helpful.\\nMITT ROMNEY: It\\'s really sad to see Tucker Carlson go off the rails that bad. The American people saw what happened on January 6. They\\'ve seen the people that got injured. They saw the damage to the building. You can\\'t hide the truth by selectively picking a few minutes out of tapes and saying this is what went on. It\\'s so absurd.\\nWeak men are vicious men, and these are weak men whose attitudes towards an individual whose life has been destroyed on the basis of false and withheld evidence is vicious. Oh, we cherrypicked? Really? What they\\'re saying, ironically, what they\\'re describing, ironically, is exactly what the January 6 Committee and the prosecutors in these cases did for two years. They selectively picked small segments of tape to convince Americans that January 6 was something that it wasn\\'t.\\nIt was awful. We would not defend that. We hate vandalism. We hate assault. Was it a violent insurrection? It was not. Was it a killing of five officers in the Capitol? It was not. Those are lies, and they buried tape that contradicted and revealed those lies.\\nSo, all we did was play the tape that they had been hiding for 26 months and show that there were American citizens, Jacob Chansley specifically, and others who civil liberties were annihilated, and you can make your own rational judgments about what that means. Do you want to live in a country where that\\'s possible? They don\\'t care. Neither party in Washington cares.\\nIn fact, the leader of the Senate Democrats, Chuck Schumer, just joined the leader of the Senate Republicans, Mitch McConnell, in calling for this show to be pulled off the air. Now, that\\'s not an argument based on logic. It\\'s based on hysteria and the shame you feel as a weak and terrified person when your lies are exposed.

Voters Disenchanted With Joe Biden, Donald Trump', 'Nicholas Morgan', datetime.datetime(2022, 7, 12, 12, 59, 25), \"Two years before the next U.S. presidential election, voters are signaling they want new blood atop the party tickets and not a rematch of the 2020 election.\\nThe sentiment comes as President Joe Biden has seen sagging approval ratings and former President Donald Trump faces potential criminal charges for the Jan. 6 Capitol Riots. Recent polling shows voter fatigue for both candidates, who are both considered leading contenders in 2024.\\nA New York Times/Siena College poll found that Republicans were nearly split on whether they wanted to see Trump return as their party's standard-bearer. About 49% said they would support him against 47% who indicated support for another candidate. Among other possible options, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis fared the best after Trump with nearly 25% support and higher numbers among college-educated and younger Republicans compared to Trump.\\nBiden did not fare much better within his own party. On Monday, the New York Times reported that 64% of Democrats would prefer to see another candidate over Biden in 2024. Support among the core groups that make up the Democratic base has crumbled, particularly among younger voters. Biden still performing relatively well with Black Americans, but his approval ratings overall remained around 38%, according to an average of polls from the FiveThirtyEight blog.\\nGoing further, a Politico-Morning Consult poll found 48% of voters surveyed said Trump should not run again and 46% said the same of Biden.\\nWhat this means for the upcoming presidential election remains uncertain. Biden has maintained that he is running again in 2024 despite increasing chatter among Democratic operatives and donors about seeking an alternative candidate. Trump has not yet committed to a run before the end of the November midterms, but he has toyed with announcing earlier to assert himself against any potential Republican rivals.\\nStill, the current mood of the electorate does not bode particularly well for either the current or former president. Economic issues, particularly inflation, top the political agenda which will naturally weigh down heavier on Biden as the incumbent. However, Trump’s grievances related to his defeat in the 2020 election do not appear to hold a galvanizing effect beyond his most faithful supporters.\\nBiden is viewed as the stronger candidate if the 2024 election is a rematch. The Times/Siena College poll found Biden ahead of Trump in a hypothetical matchup, 44% to 41%.\\nThe Washington Post recently listed potential nominees for both parties. For Democrats, the list included Vice-President Kamala Harris, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. For Republicans, the list included former Vice-President Mike Pence, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and New Hampshire Gov.

But what if an attack on Guam did occur?\\nIn that scenario, while it's impossible to know how President Trump would respond, I believe the U.S. military would recommend retaliation at one of four levels.\\nFirst, in the event that a missile strike caused no or very few casualties (less than 5), the U.S. would likely employ measured retaliation. North Korean launch sites and missile units would be destroyed, but the regime's command and control facilities would probably be left alone. Neither would the U.S. be likely to target North Korea's leadership. Instead, the overriding intent would be the removal of the ballistic missile threat and the restored U.S. balance of power. If the North Koreans attempted to reconstitute their ballistic missile program, the U.S. would destroy it again.\\nWhat if a North Korean strike inflicted casualties beyond the low digits but not in the hundreds or thousands?\\nIn that case, I believe the U.S. would target North Korean command and control elements as well as missile forces. This would almost certainly entail air- and sea-based missile engagement of command facilities across North Korea, including facilities in and around Pyongyang. Via these operations, the U.S. would want to cultivate North Korea's perception that further aggression would mean their annihilation. But it would also intend to achieve North Korea's submission to a new balance of power far more weighted to U.S. and South Korean interests.\\nThird, if a missile incident imposed major casualties but was not nuclear in nature, the U.S. would pursue the fundamental debilitation of North Korea's means of resistance.\\nWe would see massive attacks on the North's air, artillery, radar, and logistical support forces. In the first instance, the U.S. would probably hold off targeting Kim Jong Un himself, but would attempt to decapitate his senior commanders. The intent of that qualification would be to leave space for a diplomatic arrangement in which Kim Jong Un transferred power to a transitional government. Still, the U.S. would demand the transitional government was at least semi-pro American.\\nNevertheless, alongside the immediate debilitation operations, the U.S. military would also surge personnel and equipment into the region. This forward deployment would entail not just Airborne and Marine maneuver divisions, but most of the Army's armored heavy brigades. Aside from some units held to deter Russian or Iranian aggression, the military would also redeploy the bulk of its air and naval forces to Guam, Okinawa, and Japan. I would, for example, expect five or six carrier groups to head toward North Korea as soon as possible.\\nThis buildup would present Kim and China with an unmistakable expression of American military supremacy. Although this power projection capability has not been manifested in many years, it remains the unique identifier of U.S. military. In turn, North Korean military figures would face one of two choices: overthrow the Kim dynasty, or die. And beyond clarifying to China that U.S. personnel would not cross the Yalu River, there would be little attention paid to Chinese political interests. From the strategic perspective, China would have burned its rights to American concern by failing to restrain their North Korean ally.\\nFinally, there's the doomsday case of a North Korean attack involving nuclear weapons. In the event that a nuclear warhead hits Guam, the U.S. would almost certainly respond with massive nuclear retaliation. North Korean military targets would be the first priority, but Trump would also be given an option to destroy Pyongyang. Regardless, Kim and all those around him would be a dead man. The U.S. would enforce Korean unification on American terms.\\nUltimately, whatever form a North Korean attack on Guam took, the consequences for Kim would be profoundly negative. Determined to protect its citizens and preserve a deterrent posture in the 21st century, the U.S. military would recommend to Trump that he counteract North Korea with decisive applications of force.\\nThe outcome, though bloody and unpleasant for all sides, would not be in doubt. Nor would the balance of that blood and misery.\\nLet us hope China wakes up and the diplomats succeed.\"], 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trump-declaring-a-national-emergency-to-build-border-wall-with-mcconnells-support-will-come-back-to-haunt-conservatives': ['washingtonexaminer.com', \"Trump declaring a national emergency to build border wall with McConnell's support will come back to haunt conservatives\", '', datetime.datetime(2019, 2, 14, 20, 52, 58), \"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's announcement that not only would President Trump declare a national emergency to build a border wall, but that he would support it, is going to come back to haunt conservatives.\\nAs I noted last month, the possibility of an emergency declaration became a lot more likely when Trump caved on border wall funding to end the government shutdown, thus making him feel he had to find another way to show his base that he was willing to use all the tools at his disposal to try and deliver on his campaign promise.\\nThe idea of Trump taking such an action was then, and remains now, a terrible idea with dangerous consequences for limited government conservatives. McConnell's blessing makes matters even worse.\\nThose who seek to limit the size and scope of government should want it to be more difficult for the executive to arbitrarily use power. That Trump is taking this action means that a Republican president will have been on board with using emergency powers to undertake a massive infrastructure project without the consent of Congress. What's more, the Republican leader in the Senate, along with no doubt plenty of other Republicans, will have signed on this action, along with, no doubt, plenty of conservative Trump cheerleaders.\\nFor the past week, we've been debating infeasibility of the Green New Deal. But many of its provisions suddenly become a lot more politically possible if a president is allowed to seize emergency powers in such a way. If Trump succeeds, it would not be difficult for a Democrat to declare an emergency based on the National Climate Assessment, and then go about using the military for massive infrastructure projects in clean energy.\\nThe only hope for limited government conservatives is that any emergency declaration gets quickly enjoined, and eventually nixed, in federal court. At least then, the silver lining would be that a legal precedent would be set that the president cannot attempt such an end around Congress.\\nEither way, however, Trump's action and the likely overwhelming support by Congressional Republicans will shred their ability to resist any sort of attempt by a future Democratic president seeking to broadly employ executive power.\\nAnd all for what? Even in the event of an eventual victory in court, any legal process is going to take at least a year to be resolved, without much time to do actual construction before the 2020 election, which Trump could lose. So basically there's a non-zero chance that Trump will have gotten Republicans to go along with him setting a precedent for the next Democratic president, only to not even have a border wall to show for it.\\nThis is a dangerous, rash, reckless, and myopic decision that should be passionately opposed by all principled conservatives.\"], 'http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2016/10/13/deluge-two-more-women-now-allege-trump-groping-incidents-n2231550': ['townhall.com', 'Out of the Woodwork: After Trump Denies Groping at Debate, Multiple Accusers Go Public', 'Guy Benson, Matt Vespa, Leah Barkoukis, Sarah Arnold', datetime.datetime(2016, 10, 13, 8, 1), 'On Friday, the tape came out. On Saturday and Sunday, Trump allies and others warned that there was more to come. And so here we are. The Republican presidential nominee\\'s campaign is in chaos, fending off allegations from four separate women -- all going public on the same day, \"coincidentally\" -- that he fondled, kissed, or groped them without their consent. The alleged incidents date as far back as the 1980\\'s, through as recently as 2013. None of these women went to the authorities at the time, but all have friends or family who confirm that they reported the episodes contemporaneously. Matt told you about the New York Times report last night. As those accusations entered the media bloodstream, more pieces dropped. A Yahoo! News story links to a Facebook post from a 2013 Miss Universe contestant who describes Trump\\'s degrading treatment of the women in the pageant, later commenting that Trump \"continually grabbed my ass\" during the process. She is daring Trump to sue her, saying that she has \"worse stories\" she could share. Separately, here\\'s a Florida allegation via the Palm Beach Post:\\nFor more than 10 years, it was something Mindy McGillivray said she shared only with a close circle of family and friends. That changed Sunday night. Donald Trump was asked during the presidential debate about when he bragged that he kissed women without their consent and grabbed their genitals – remarks captured on audio that surfaced last week. Trump apologized for the remarks and dismissed them as “locker room talk.” But the debate moderator, CNN’s Anderson Cooper, asked Trump to clarify: “Have you ever done those things?” “No, I have not,\" Trump replied. Watching at home in Palm Springs, McGillivray said she rose from her couch and yelled at the TV screen: ‘You liar!’ McGillivray, 36, said she was groped by Trump at Mar-a-Lago 13 years ago. She said she never reported it to authorities. But her companion that day, photographer Ken Davidoff, vividly remembers when McGillivray pulled him aside moments after the alleged incident and told him, \"Donald just grabbed my ass!\"\\nThese women\\'s stories come in addition to the two women quoted in Wednesday\\'s New York Times report, one of whom reported unwelcome kissing; the other, an up-the-skirt groping on an airplane by Mr. Trump. This brings the total of women accusing Trump of unwanted physical touching to six, by my unofficial count, including another pageant participant (\"he kissed me directly on the lips\") and a writer for People magazine (\"he was pushing me against the wall, and forcing his tongue down my throat\"). Besieged by allegations they call untrue, Trump\\'s team is reportedly mulling lawsuits against various media outlets. But there are a few problems here. First, some of these women have told the same consistent story in private for years, which lends credibility to their claims. Second, and most damning, they are telling the world that Donald Trump did to them...precisely the sort of thing he is on tape saying he does to women:\\nBiggest problem for Trump amid new allegations: He said on tape this is what he does to women. — Guy Benson (@guypbenson) October 12, 2016\\n\"Just kiss,\" he told Billy Bush in 2005, explaining his attitudes on making sexual advances. \"When you\\'re a star...you can do anything. Grab them by the p***sy.\" Lawsuits will draw even more attention to the story, and Trump is very likely to lose in court, if he even pulls the trigger because the standard for proving libel of a public figure is quite high. And in the court of public opinion, Trump\\'s own words add to the plausibility -- if not probability -- of his accusers\\' stories. Ever since he flatly denied that he\\'d ever followed through on the actions mentioned in his so-called \"locker room talk\" during a nationally-televised presidential debate on Sunday, women began coming out of the woodwork. These details come in addition to yet more tales of Trump\\'s conduct, including barging in on naked beauty pageant contestants -- some as young as 15 -- in their changing rooms, which he later boastingly confirmed in interviews with Howard Stern. And there\\'s this old chestnut dug up by CBS News, in which a 46-year-old Trump charmingly tells a group of ten-year-old girls that he\\'ll be dating one of them in a decade:\\nThat\\'s little more than a creepy joke, but it\\'s not the first time Trump has talked about young girls in the context of their future sexuality -- including this mind-bogglingly appalling comment about his own daughter, who was an infant at the time.

But now, just like we\\'ve seen at NBC, it\\'s destruction time. The media chose the GOP nominee, then turned on him with a vengeance. As predicted.

What were all those people doing there, and what did they hope to accomplish?\\nThe corporate press, Big Tech monopolists, Democrats, and quite a few Republicans and right-of-center media outlets aren’t at all interested in those questions. They don’t care. To them, the people who rallied in support of President Trump last Wednesday and marched to the U.S. Capitol—whether or not they took part in the violence—are nothing more than traitors.\\nIt doesn’t matter that the vast majority didn’t so much as jostle a barrier, let alone smash a window or throw a punch. Didn’t you hear? Those people tried to stage a coup. Trump incited them. They’re terrorists and insurrectionists, and all we need to know about them is where they live and who they work for.\\nThat’s how you respond to the horrible events of Jan. 6 if you want to deepen the divisions in America and make it impossible to live together in peace. But if you want to fix what’s wrong and salvage our broken republic, you at least have to try and understand why so many Trump supporters gathered at the U.S. Capitol last week. And yes, you can do that without condoning or excusing the idiots who attacked the police.\\nThat’s not hard to do, although the left has had trouble with it this year. When it was Antifa and Black Lives Matter activists demonstrating and rioting in the streets and attacking police, corporate journalists churned out essays and commentary that either tacitly or explicitly endorsed the violence, while insisting that we understand and sympathize with the ideology and outrage fueling it. Some argued that we must kneel, literally, and profess BLM dogma, or be branded a racist.\\nBy contrast, almost no one has insisted that we understand or sympathize with the cause of the peaceful protesters who marched to the capitol, to say nothing of the people themselves. So I decided to talk to some of them.\\n‘I’m Shocked to The Core’\\nJaron Pensinger, a 21-year-old student at Georgetown University, told me he went to the protest for two reasons: to voice his opposition to what he believes are unjustifiable pandemic lockdowns, and to raise awareness about mail-in ballot fraud in the November election.\\n“I’m concerned that the Democrats actually changed and loosened election laws over the summer and made them less stringent,” he said. “So now more than ever we should be investigating fraud, and I felt like the Democratic Party just swept it under the rug and didn’t want to investigate anything.”\\nPensinger specifically asked me to use his name because his school newspaper, The Hoya, ran a hit piece on him this week, badly mischaracterizing his presence at the protests, which the paper described as a “coup attempt,” and associating him with the violence that broke out at the U.S. Capitol.\\nPensinger attended the protest with two other Georgetown students, and he says they were caught “completely unaware” when they saw from a distance people pushing against police barricades, because the vast majority of the protesters—hundreds of thousands of them—were peacefully demonstrating. He says that where he was on the capitol grounds, he didn’t see anyone so much as cross a security barrier.\\n“We were just peacefully assembling,” he said. “And I assumed that this was going to be a completely peaceful statement to our government that we would like more investigation into the election and perhaps stop with these covid lockdowns.” Pensinger says he’s “shocked to the core” that anyone would portray it as an attempted coup or an insurrection.\\n‘We Had A Civic Duty to Our Country to Attend’\\nNot everyone wanted to speak on the record, for fear of harassment and threats. Another college student I talked to drove six hours with her mother to attend the rally and protest. She said she felt she had “a civic duty to our country to attend,” given the “substantial evidence of voter fraud and irregularities.”\\n“We want to stand up and show that we’re following the news and we’re reading between the lines,” she said. “I think the mainstream media has largely failed to report upon very concerning evidence of voter fraud. And really we just wanted our voices to be heard.”\\nShe says the crowd around her, both at the White House Ellipse where Trump spoke and when she and her mother marched to the U.S. Capitol grounds, was “calm and respectful,” and that there were a lot of young families with babies, elderly couples, and military veterans in uniform. One group had traveled all the way from Hawaii to be there.\\nThis student and her mother decided to go back to their hotel to charge their phones and rest before coming back later that evening, but as soon as they left the area, she starting getting texts that “they stormed the capitol, somehow they got into the capitol.” At that point, she heard sirens and saw police cars speeding toward the capitol, so they decided not to go back.\\nLike Pensinger and every other person I spoke to, they obeyed DC Mayor Muriel Bowser’s 6 p.m. curfew that night and stayed in their hotel rooms—an odd thing for “insurrectionists” to do. She never expected the protest to turn violent: “I absolutely did not intend to enter the capitol, I obviously did not enter the capitol, and if anyone would have told me on Tuesday or Wednesday morning that others had that intention, I would have just laughed.”\\n‘I Didn’t Have Any Delusions of Grandeur’\\nSo, far from being the launch-point of an insurrection, much of what was planned for last Wednesday was orderly and ordinary—permitted groups planning events and speakers at the capitol grounds to draw attention to election fraud and irregularities that were ignored or dismissed by the corporate press.\\nOne such event organizer was Nathan Martin, an Iraq War veteran and city councilman in Shelby, Ohio. His group had obtained a permit from the Capitol Police, along with a bunch of other groups that planned events for that day. “We went through all the steps,” he said.\\nAs for the march to the capitol grounds, “We didn’t think it would change the outcome” of the election. Martin’s hope was that Republican lawmakers would put their objections on the record and go through the claims of election fraud, “line by line,” especially claims in states where instances of fraud and election irregularities were well-documented.\\n“That’s it. I didn’t have any delusions of grandeur that Vice President Pence would come swooping in and change the results or anything like that,” he said. “Although there had been some constitutional talk about whether that was allowed or not, I didn’t feel constitutionally that there was room for that.” At best, Martin says he was hoping for an election commission to look into fraud, and that maybe some good would come from that.\\nAfter Trump spoke, Martin went back to his hotel to get some supplies for their planned event. When he returned, he at first saw no signs that anything was amiss or that any part of the capitol security had been breached (and because there was no cell service, he didn’t know about the violent clashes with police).\\nHe was walking around the capitol grounds looking for his parents, who had driven down from Pennsylvania because they “wanted to pray over the capitol grounds and pray for our country,” when he saw some people going into the capitol through a side door. That didn’t seem quite right to him. A short time later, he says, the metro police showed up, “And it was at that point I realized that, you know what, I’m going to go back to my hotel.”\\nBack at the hotel, he learned what had happened. “All of our objectives, everything that we wanted to achieve, was destroyed in a matter of hours,” he said. “I don’t think we’re going to get an election integrity commission. I don’t think we’re going to get accountability or really fully know what happened.”\\n‘It Just Incensed Me’\\nNot everyone I talked to was opposed to civil disobedience or pushing past security barriers at the capitol. One man, a 62-year-old software engineer who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from his employer, told me he hadn’t planned to force his way into the U.S. Capitol or break any rules. But in the moment, something changed.\\nInitially, he’d hoped that the sight of a mass demonstration on the capitol grounds would give “weak-knee Republicans” the courage to “stand up and save our country.” He thought there was a last-ditch chance that GOP lawmakers would be able to force a vote on electors in the House, by state delegation.\\nOnce he got to the capitol itself, he didn’t see anyone fighting with police or throwing objects, but he did see people pushing and pulling on the barriers. He and a friend were pretty far back, he says, so they walked around to an open area on the south side of the complex where he encountered a flimsy fence and a sign that said “No Entry Beyond This Point.” Beyond that were a few Capitol Police, just standing around.\\n“When I saw that I just kind of got—mad is not the right word, but I just got indignant, you know?” He says after nine of months of rioting and mayhem in U.S. cities, supported by Democrats and the media, the authorities at the capitol just assumed that pro-Trump protesters would obey the rules and do as they were told.\\nHe told me, “I walked up to that [barrier] and said, ‘These people want me to keep off the grass and stay behind their barriers and obey the rules?’ And it just incensed me. I just couldn’t believe these people. So I start pushing and pulling on the stupid barrier at that point, I said, ‘I’m going in there.’ But it didn’t last long.”\\nHe says a capitol police officer was walking down the line with a big canister of liquid pepper spray and dousing anyone who jostled the barrier, and he got hit full in the face. His friend pulled him back and it took him hours to recover. He never made it into the capitol.\\nEven if he had, though, he says goal wasn’t to hurt anyone or stage a coup, or anything of the sort. It was to make a statement.\\nOur civil disobedience is, we’re going to walk into this building and wave the American flag. That’s what I felt like everybody who was around me, that’s what their attitude was. It wasn’t beating up officers, it wasn’t tearing things down or destroying. It was, that’s our building and we’re gonna go in there and wave the American flag. And if it puts a little fear of God into those people, I could care less.\\nNot everyone will agree with that view. I don’t. But I do understand it. It makes sense to me that some people, even law-abiding software engineers in their sixties, might get so fed up with the hypocrisy and contempt shown to them by our ruling class that they decide they’re going to break a few rules, push past a few barriers, and make their voices heard.\\nThe vast majority of the protesters didn’t quite get there. But they did get to the point where they were willing to travel across the country to protest what they believe, not without good reason, was an unfair election. Far from being insurrectionist, theirs is a quintessentially American impulse—and the news media would have said as much if the protesters, and even the rioters, had been left-wing activists objecting to a Trump victory.\\nBut they weren’t. So no one in the press or the halls of power will ever say a sympathetic word about them. They’ll be shunned from polite society and branded as traitors and terrorists and conspiracy theorists. They’ll be kicked off social media and mocked by cable news. If they have podcasts or YouTube channels, those will be shut down. Some of them will even be fired from their jobs and harassed in the street for nothing more than expressing a political opinion.\\nBut they won’t go away.\\nJohn Daniel Davidson is a senior editor at The Federalist.

Five different policies in two weeks\", 'Spencer Ackerman', datetime.datetime(2017, 4, 11, 10, 0, 3), 'Confused by Donald Trump’s policy on Syria? That just means you’ve been listening to what his administration has been saying in the last few days.\\nThe US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is to fly to Moscow on Tuesday, where the novice US diplomat is expected to discuss the fate of Bashar al-Assad. Meanwhile, the world is still trying to understand just what goal Trump’s fledgling administration is pursuing in Syria.\\nFor years, Trump advocated against intervention in Syria’s war, except to attack the Islamic State militant group in a related but separate conflict. That policy seemed to end on Thursday, after the chemical weapons attack on Khan Sheikhoun on 4 April. Yet almost as soon as Trump ordered retaliatory strikes on a Syrian airbase from which the US said the regime had launched the chemical attack, his aides suggested that the one-off strike had satisfied US objectives.\\nUntil they contradicted themselves again.\\nIt may not be clear what the US policy toward Syria actually is, including to senior policymakers whose divergent and even contradictory statements have overlapped with one another. But here, at least, is what they have said.\\nPolicy 1 – Assad can stay: 2013 – 30 March 2017\\nFor years, as a private citizen on Twitter and as a presidential candidate, Trump was fine with Assad remaining in power, contending that the US should not get sucked into another Middle Eastern conflict, particularly one against a leader backed by Russia. After winning the election, Trump told the Wall Street Journal: “My attitude was you’re fighting Syria, Syria is fighting Isis, and you have to get rid of Isis.” Assad quickly called Trump a “natural ally”.\\nOn 30 March, Trump’s senior diplomats articulated that position clearly. Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations, mused that the US needed to “pick and choose [its] battles”, despite Assad’s human rights abuses: “Our priority is no longer to sit and focus on getting Assad out.”\\nThat same day, in Turkey, Tillerson said Assad’s “longer-term status ... will be decided by the Syrian people”.\\nSince the Syrian people live in one of the world’s bloodiest war zones, besieged by Assad’s forces and others, observers understood Tillerson and Haley to say that the US was abandoning Barack Obama’s rhetorical commitment to Assad’s removal. Senator John McCain, a hawk on Syria, called himself “deeply disturbed” by Tillerson and Haley’s position.\\n“Ultimately, the administration’s statements today could lead America’s true allies and partners in the fight against Isis to fear the worst: a Faustian bargain with Assad and Putin sealed with an empty promise of counter-terrorism cooperation,” McCain said.\\nFive days later, Assad killed at least 70 people in Khan Sheikhoun, including children, with the nerve agent sarin.\\nPolicy 2 – Assad must go, after chemical attack: 5-6 April 2017\\nBy Wednesday, the first day dominated by images of the dead at Khan Sheikhoun, Trump expressed public anger, saying Assad had crossed “many, many lines”. By then, military planning for a retaliatory strike was under way.\\nBut what was the objective of the strike? Hours before guided-missile destroyers launched 59 Tomahawk missiles on Thursday, Tillerson indicated that Trump had reversed himself completely. Tillerson certainly had.\\n“Assad’s role in the future is uncertain, clearly. With the acts that he has taken, it would seem that there would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people,” he said. Asked if the US was prepared to diplomatically rally an international coalition to remove Assad from power through what Tillerson called “a political process”, Tillerson responded: “Those steps are under way.”\\nThe missiles that soon landed on the Shayrat airbase seemed, accordingly, to mark the first salvo toward the US ousting Assad.\\nPolicy 3 – The issue is chemical weapons use, not Assad: 6-10 April 2017\\nHours after the missile strike, the newly empowered national security adviser HR McMaster, whose career was made by a different Middle Eastern war, defined the US attack in minimalist terms: “It was aimed at the capacity to commit mass murder with chemical weapons, but it was not of a scope or a scale that it would go after all such related facilities.” Next to McMaster, Tillerson said the chemical attack was “particular[ly] heinous”, over and above Assad’s brutality with conventional weapons.\\nNotably absent from McMaster’s explanation of the strikes was any indication of whether Assad’s removal was a US objective at all. (The strike itself would not have affected Assad’s hold on power, but if endangering that hold were once again a US goal, it would have to be the first of many.) Instead, McMaster said, the strike ought to prompt “a big shift in Assad’s calculus” against chemical weapons use. Assad’s calculus, however, should not matter to the US if he is no longer in power.\\nOn 10 April, the US defense secretary, James Mattis, issued a statement similar to that of his ally McMaster: “The Syrian government would be ill-advised ever again to use chemical weapons.” But that was after several statements with different policy implications.\\nPolicy 4 – Attack Isis first, then Assad can stay or go depending on whether Russia agrees: 9 April 2017\\nTillerson, making his first appearance on the Sunday chatshows, sounded more like his 30 March self than his 6 April incarnation. “Our priority is first the defeat of Isis,” he said – which, in fairness, he had also said on 6 April in what seemed like a throwaway line. Once the US could “conclude” that war, the US would attempt to broker ceasefire agreements between the Syrian civil war’s various combatants – even though Assad, with Russian support, has violated ceasefires in the past.\\nTillerson said he was “hopeful” to work with Russia “and use their influence to achieve areas of stabilization throughout Syria and create the conditions for a political process through Geneva in which we can engage all of the parties on a way forward”.\\nThrough that process – apparently not yet “under way”, despite Tillerson’s 6 April statement – the international community would “decide the fate of Bashar Assad”.\\nNothing about Tillerson’s statement implied that Assad’s “fate” would be to leave power. The “areas of stabilization” in Syria that Russia has facilitated have propped Assad up, and Russia has shown no signs of abandoning its client. Nor did Tillerson define when the US would “conclude” its war against Isis.\\nBeyond that, Tillerson implied that overthrowing Assad would be disastrous, citing Obama’s adventurism in Libya that toppled Muammar Gaddafi: “Any time you go in and have a violent change at the top, it is very difficult to create the conditions for stability longer-term.”\\nBut if Tillerson was again prizing stability over regime change, Haley was doing the opposite.\\nHaley, reversing her own 30 March statement thoroughly, said the US could have “multiple priorities” in Syria beyond defeating Isis. She agreed with Tillerson on the importance of “the political solution”, but filled in the blanks on where the US wanted it to end up: “In no way do we see peace in that area with Assad as the head of the Syrian government, and we have to make sure that we’re pushing that process. The political solution has to come together for the good of the people of Syria.”\\nThe message to Russia, Haley told NBC, was: “We’re not going to allow you to cover up for this regime anymore.”\\nMcMaster, in an interview with Fox News, seemed to back Haley’s vision of US diplomacy for Syria, all while placing the onus for Assad’s fate on Russia.\\n“It’s very difficult to understand how a political solution could result from the continuation of the Assad regime. Now, we are not saying that we are the ones who are going to effect that change,” McMaster said, saying Russia had to ask “hard questions” about “are we supporting this murderous regime that is committing mass murder of its own population and using the most heinous weapons available?”\\nMuddying the waters of Tillerson’s Isis-first approach, McMaster said: “There has to be a degree of simultaneous activity as well as sequencing of the defeat of Isis first.”\\nAsked why the US drew the line at chemical weapons, rather than the barrel bombs Assad’s forces have used to kill countless more Syrian civilians, Haley replied: “That’s a decision for the president to make.” McMaster, asked the same question, agreed: “The president will make whatever decision he thinks is in the best interest of the American people.”\\nPolicy 5 – The US will respond militarily to barrel bombs: 10 April\\nSean Spicer, the White House press secretary, on Monday implied Trump had made the decision to which Haley and McMaster alluded. Now the US placed barrel bombs along the continuum with chemical weapons. Since the US had responded to chemical weapons with Tomahawk missiles, Spicer’s comments suggested an even deeper US military engagement in Syria unrelated to chemical weapons, even as McMaster had defined the strike in a manner that suggested the US merely sought to establish a credible deterrent against future chemical weapons use.\\n“The sight of people being gassed and blown away by barrel bombs ensures that if we see this kind of action again, we hold open the possibility of future action,” Spicer said, reading from prepared – presumably deliberate – remarks.\\nSpicer, following criticism, later said that he only meant to refer to barrel bombs that contained chlorine or other industrial chemicals. But that would still represent a substantial expansion of the US rules of engagement in Syria. The regime is suspected of using chlorine gas in its attacks on at least 16 occasions since 2013.\\nWithin hours, Mattis released a statement once again defining the US objectives minimally – and with clarity atypical of the Trump administration.\\n“The US military strike against Shayrat airfield on April 6 was a measured response to the Syrian government’s use of chemical weapons,” said Mattis, a veteran of two different Iraq wars and Afghanistan.\\n“The president directed this action to deter future use of chemical weapons and to show the United States will not passively stand by while Assad murders innocent people with chemical weapons, which are prohibited by international law and which were declared destroyed.”\\nMattis made no mention of barrel bombs, suggesting a less definitive posture than the one Spicer presented.\\nIt remains to be seen whether Tillerson will announce a sixth policy for Syria when in Moscow.'], 'https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/emmaloop/lev-parnas-giuliani-trump-notes-texts-impeachment': ['buzzfeedcom', \"Here's New Impeachment Evidence Lev Parnas, Rudy Giuliani's Associate, Turned Over To Congress\", 'Michael Sallah, Zoe Tillman, Emma Loop, Buzzfeed News Reporter', datetime.datetime(2020, 1, 15, 1, 52, 29), 'The interview aired after House Democrats released hundreds of pages of new documents related to the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, including texts and notes turned over by Parnas.\\nThree House committees sent the evidence to the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday “to be included as part of the official record that will be transmitted to the Senate along with the Articles of Impeachment.” The House sent the articles to the Senate on Wednesday evening.\\nIn a statement to MSNBC as the interview aired, Giuliani said Parnas had \"never\" spoken on behalf of Trump in his meetings.\\nHe added that Parnas is \"a very sad situation.\"\\nThe evidence sent by the Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs committees included documents provided recently by Parnas, who helped Giuliani dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, in response to a subpoena he received from the House in October.

Trial lawyers know that cross-examination is the most effective truth-testing tool available to them.\\nBut the search for the truth requires witnesses, and when the command from Senate Republican leaders came down that there shall be no witnesses, the truth-telling mission of Trump\\'s trial was radically transformed into a steamroller of political power.\\nGREGG JARRETT: TRUMP ACQUITTAL IN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS A HUMILIATING DEFEAT FOR PARTISAN DEMOCRATS\\nAnd in its wake is a Congress ceding power to the presidency, almost as if the states had ratified a constitutional amendment redefining the impeachment language to permit a president to engage in high crimes and misdemeanors so long as he believes that they are in the national interest and so long as his party has an iron-clad grip on the Senate.\\nHow could presidential crimes be in the national interest? Here is the backstory.\\nWhen the House of Representatives voted in favor of two articles of impeachment against Trump, it characterized his lawlessness as contempt of Congress and an abuse of power.\\nThe contempt of Congress consisted of Trump\\'s orders to subordinates to disregard congressional subpoenas. Both Republican- and Democratic-controlled Houses of Representatives have deemed such presidential instructions in an impeachment inquiry as impeachable per se.\\nThe abuse allegations address Trump\\'s solicitation of assistance for his reelection campaign from a foreign government by holding up the release of $391 million in military aid to the same foreign government. These funds were congressionally appropriated and ordered to be paid by legislation that Trump had signed into law.\\nFederal law prohibits such solicitation as criminal and prohibits government officials from seeking personal favors in return for performing their governmental duties. The latter is bribery.\\nBecause the solicitation that Trump committed was a crime against the government, it is among those referred to when the Constitution was written as a \"high\" crime. High crimes are a constitutional basis for impeachment, along with bribery and treason.\\nThe evidence that Trump did this is overwhelming and beyond a reasonable doubt, and no one with firsthand knowledge denied it. Numerous government officials recounted that the presidential leverage of $391 million in U.S. assistance for a personal political favor did occur and the government\\'s own watchdog concluded that it was indisputably unlawful.\\nThe favor Trump sought was an announcement by the Ukrainian government of the commencement of an investigation of Trump\\'s potential presidential foe, former Vice President Joe Biden.\\nWhile the Senate was hearing House prosecution managers argue their case, and Trump\\'s lawyers challenged those arguments, The New York Times revealed that John Bolton, Trump\\'s former national security adviser, had authored an as yet unpublished book demonstrating that the House case against Trump was true.\\nTrue because, unlike the senators who shut their eyes and ears at Trump\\'s trial, Bolton saw for himself the presidential tit-for-tat machinations that the House had alleged and, if proven, were criminal and impeachable.\\nThe Times also revealed the existence of 24 emails sent by Trump aides manifesting indisputably his lawless behavior. But the emails are secret.\\nAt the same time, two signal events occurred in the impeachment trial. The first was an argument by Trump\\'s lawyers that every president seeking reelection believes his victory will be in the national interest and thus all presidential efforts toward that victory are constitutional and lawful.\\nThis morally bankrupt, intellectually dishonest argument – which effectively resuscitates from history\\'s graveyard President Richard Nixon’s logic that \"when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal\" because the president is above the law – must have resonated with Senate Republican leaders.\\nThe leaders coerced their Senate Republican colleagues into embracing the view that – since the president did not want Bolton to testify or White House emails to be revealed – they must bar all witnesses and documents.\\nThe second signal event was shameful. It was the 51 to 49 Senate vote to bar witnesses and documents from the trial.\\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\\nIsn\\'t it odd that a president who clamors for exoneration, who claimed loud and long that he committed no crime and did no wrong, who insisted that his request to the Ukrainian president to seek dirt on Biden in return for American financial assistance was \"perfect,\" would command the members of his own party to block testimony adverse to him – rather than hear it, cross-examine it, challenge it and thereby obtain the exoneration on the merits that he seeks?\\nDo innocent people behave this way?\\nIf Trump really believes he did not commit any crimes and any impeachable offenses, why would he orchestrate blocking evidence?

It was revealed on Monday that House Democrats are considering adding additional articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, Fox News reported. The revelation came about when a lawyer for the House Judiciary Committee Democrats filed a brief with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that they must have former White House Counsel Don McGahn testify before the Committee as part of their impeachment proceedings.\\nDemocrats originally wanted to hear from McGahn as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\\'s investigation into Russia and whether or not President Donald Trump colluded with the Kremlin. They wanted to know about the claim that Trump wanted to fire Mueller. When the White House invoked executive privilege, Democrats were quick to say this was an obstruction of justice.\\nAccording to the Democrats, McGahn\\'s testimony could be vital for the House and could play a part in whether or not they decide to recommend new articles of impeachment.\\n“If McGahn’s testimony produces new evidence supporting the conclusion that President Trump committed impeachable offenses that are not covered by the Articles approved by the House, the Committee will proceed accordingly---including, if necessary, by considering whether to recommend new articles of impeachment,” the brief stated, noting that they still have “ongoing impeachment investigations.”\\nThe brief did not go into detail about what new articles the House would consider. Even if the House declines to add additional articles, McGahn\\'s testimony could be used in a Senate trial.\\nThe Department of Justice argued that one of the Democrats\\' articles of impeachments are based on the very court case that the Court of Appeals was hearing, which is why they feel the case should be dismissed in its entirety.\\n\"[T]he article of impeachment addressing purported obstruction of Congress relies in part on the judicial proceedings in this very case,\" the DOJ wrote. \"Indeed, if this Court now were to resolve the merits question in this case, it would appear to be weighing in on a contested issue in any impeachment trial,\" which is why the court \"should decline the Committee\\'s request that it enter the fray and instead should dismiss this fraught suit between the political branches for lack of jurisdiction.\"\\nAccording to the DOJ, there is no need for the Court to expedite a decision before the January 3rd oral arguments. The Committee previously said they wanted the decision expedited so the House could continue their impeachment investigations. Now that the House has voted and approved their two articles of impeachment, expediting them is unnecessary.\\nBoth sides are also fighting over another case. House Judiciary Committee Democrats are seeking grand jury information related to the Mueller investigation. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure prohibit grand jury material from being released except for in special cases, which include judicial proceedings.\\nLawyers for the Department of Justice argued that the material is not relevant because the House\\'s articles of impeachment are based on Ukraine, not the Russia probe.\\n“Neither article of impeachment adopted by the House, however, alleges high crimes or misdemeanors stemming from the events described in the Mueller Report. Accordingly, nothing appears to remain of the Committee’s alleged need for the grand-jury materials in the Mueller Report,” the DOJ wrote in their filing.'], 'https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-reporter-confirmed-atlantics-story-about-trump-insulting-fallen-troops-fox-hosts': ['mediamatters', 'A Fox News reporter confirmed The Atlantic’s story about Trump insulting fallen troops.

And for a whole year now, the insurrection itself has been lied about.\\nDonald Trump supporters’ violent attack on the Capitol has been the subject of a dishonesty campaign that began amid the fog of January 6 and escalated even as the facts became clearer. Trump, some right-wing media figures and some Republican members of Congress have mounted a sustained effort to rewrite the history of that deadly day.\\nThey have falsely claimed all of the rioters were unarmed. They have falsely claimed the people at the Capitol merely held a “protest” against an election they falsely claimed was fraudulent. They have falsely claimed the rioters were welcomed into the Capitol by police officers.\\nThey have falsely claimed the riot was orchestrated by left-wing groups or the FBI. And they have falsely claimed nonviolent rioters are being jailed as “political prisoners.”\\nHere is a fact check of five of the most enduring lies about January 6.\\nLie: The rioters were completely unarmed\\nTrump and some of his allies continue to claim that all of the people at the Capitol on January 6 were unarmed.\\nIn a December 21 statement, Trump called January 6 a “completely unarmed protest.” Similarly, in a tweet on December 17, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia wrote, “One of the biggest holes in the lie about J6 being a planned insurrection is that all the people there were unarmed. Anyone with half a brain knows that gun owners only leave their firearms at home when they don’t feel the need to carry a gun or are obeying the law.”\\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that all of the people at the Capitol on January 6 were unarmed – and the claim is still false even if it is specifically about guns. People who illegally entered Capitol grounds during the insurrection were armed with a wide variety of weapons, including guns, stun guns, knives, batons, baseball bats, axes and chemical sprays. The Department of Justice said in an official update last week that so far “over 75” people charged in connection to the attack “have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon.”\\nWe may never get a complete inventory of the concealed weapons the rioters possessed on January 6, since nearly all of the rioters were able to leave the Capitol without being detained and searched. But prosecutors have alleged that some of the people present at the Capitol were armed with guns, as were some other Trump supporters who traveled to Washington for January 6.\\nMark Mazza of Indiana has been charged with crimes including possession of a firearm on Capitol grounds; he has pleaded not guilty. According to the Capitol Police, Mazza accidentally dropped his loaded revolver during a struggle with police on a Capitol terrace. He allegedly told investigators later that if he had visited House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that day, “you’d be here for another reason.”\\nGuy Reffitt of Texas has been charged with crimes including illegally carrying a semi-automatic handgun on Capitol grounds; he has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors allege Reffitt “specifically targeted at least two lawmakers – the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and then-Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell – whom he sought to physically remove or displace from the Capitol building.” And police allege Christopher Alberts of Maryland was arrested trying to flee Capitol grounds on January 6 with a loaded pistol; he has pleaded not guilty.\\nMark Ibrahim, who was an off-duty special agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration at the time of the riot, has been charged with crimes including carrying a firearm on Capitol grounds. Ibrahim, who has said he was later fired by the DEA (the DEA would confirm to CNN only that he no longer works there), was photographed that day displaying what appeared to be a handgun. He has pleaded not guilty.\\nIn addition, Lonnie Coffman of Alabama, who pleaded guilty to weapons charges in November, admitted that he had carried two loaded pistols in Washington on January 6 and that a truck he had parked blocks from the Capitol contained additional loaded guns, Molotov cocktails and other weapons. Cleveland Meredith Jr., who pleaded guilty to threatening to kill Pelosi and was sentenced to 28 months in prison, drove from Colorado to Washington with a rifle and handgun that were found in his trailer outside a Washington hotel. The FBI said Meredith had told agents he had tried to get to Washington on January 5 but ended up arriving late on January 6.\\nLie: The rioters were merely protesting a ‘rigged’ election\\nTrump called on his supporters to come to Washington on January 6 for a “wild” protest against President Joe Biden’s victory, which Trump falsely claimed was fraudulent. During his rally speech on the morning of January 6, Trump pushed that election lie, directed supporters to march to the Capitol and urged them to “fight like hell.”\\nAfter the insurrection, Trump continued to repeat the election lie for months – and adapted it to minimize what had happened at the Capitol. In an October statement, he claimed that the “real insurrection” was the 2020 election and January 6 was simply a “day of protesting.” (He also made similar claims later in the year.)\\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are obvious lies. The election wasn’t rigged and wasn’t fraudulent; Biden won fair and square; there was a tiny smattering of voter fraud that was nowhere near widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state, let alone to have reversed Biden’s 306-232 victory in the Electoral College. And the insurrection of January 6 – in which approximately 140 police officers were assaulted and the peaceful transfer of power was violently interrupted – involved thousands of alleged crimes; it was, very clearly, no mere protest.\\n“This was not a peaceful protest. Hundreds of people came to Washington, DC, to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power,” Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court said last January. Howell added in October: “The rioters attacking the US Capitol on January 6th, as part of a large mob, were not mere trespassers engaging in protected First Amendment protests; they were certainly not tourists. And I say that again and again because there still seems, in some areas, to be a debate about that issue.”\\nLie: The rioters were invited into the Capitol by police\\nA common refrain from January 6 rioters, and some of their Republican defenders, is that they were welcomed into the Capitol by police officers.\\nTrump said in a book interview in March that “the Capitol Police were ushering people in” and “the Capitol Police were very friendly. You know, they were hugging and kissing.” The claim has been echoed by Trump supporters. For example, Trump-endorsed Republican Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake declared at a Trump rally in October that the people being held in jail over the Capitol attack “were invited in by Capitol Police.”\\nFacts First: The claim that the rioters were invited into the Capitol is false. Again, about 140 police officers were assaulted while trying to stop the mob from breaching the Capitol. There were hours-long battles between police and rioters near some entrances. CNN obtained footage from police body-worn cameras showing how dozens of officers engaged in hand-to-hand combat with rioters in a desperate effort to keep them out of the building.\\nRioters inside the Capitol after breaching barricades on Jan. 6, 2021. Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg/Getty Images\\nThere are plenty of instances where rioters waltzed into the Capitol without a fight, but only after they had stormed past barricades and, in some cases, even stepped through broken windows. In some areas, police were so outnumbered by the mob that they retreated, stood aside or tried to politely engage with rioters to de-escalate the situation rather than fighting or making arrests, but that is clearly not the same as welcoming rioters into the building.\\nSince we don’t have video of every single encounter between police and rioters, it’s theoretically possible that some tiny number of officers did invite rioters in. The Capitol Police announced in September that three officers were facing discipline for unspecified noncriminal “conduct unbecoming” that day, while three others were facing discipline for other policy violations.\\nBut no evidence has publicly emerged to date of even one officer inviting a rioter into the Capitol. And even if a few isolated incidents emerge in the future, it’s clear that this was not a widespread or systemic occurrence as Trump and others suggested.\\nCapitol Police Chief Tom Manger said on CNN in September: “The officers that we have investigated and disciplined, the cases that we investigated, they run from minor infractions to officers making very poor judgments for more serious misconduct. But this notion that the Capitol Police were somehow allowing these folks into the Capitol, inviting them in, helping them, just simply not true.”\\nLie: The jailed rioters are nonviolent political prisoners\\nOne of the most prevalent counternarratives about January 6 is that a large number of nonviolent people who were present at the Capitol are being unfairly prosecuted by liberal zealots at the Justice Department, and that these nonviolent people have now become “political prisoners” while awaiting trial in jail. Such claims have emerged as a rallying cry among a small but vocal cohort of Trump loyalists in the House Republican conference.\\nArizona Rep. Paul Gosar claimed in July that jailed rioters who had supposedly spent time in solitary confinement “are not unruly or dangerous, violent criminals” but are “political prisoners who are now being persecuted”; he suggested that there are “nearly 200” nonviolent Capitol participants behind bars. And the pro-Trump group behind September’s “Justice for J6” rally said its event was meant “to bring awareness and attention to the unjust and unethical treatment of nonviolent January 6 political prisoners.”\\nFacts First: This “political prisoners” narrative is false. The vast majority of the 700-plus people charged in the Capitol riot to date were released shortly after their arrests. Only a few dozen were ordered by judges to remain in jail before trial, and most of those defendants were charged with attacking police or conspiring with far-right militia groups.\\nIt’s true that the conditions are poor at the Washington jail where incarcerated rioters are being held. And it’s obviously unpleasant for anyone to live behind bars. But the small subset of January 6 defendants who are currently in jail are there only because a federal judge ruled that they are either too dangerous to release or pose a flight risk. The decision to keep them incarcerated was not made by Biden’s political appointees or any other Justice Department officials.\\nA few rioters have claimed in court that they are the victims of politically motivated prosecution because they support Trump. Federal judges, including those appointed by Trump, have rejected these arguments.\\nLie: January 6 was a false flag attack\\nBefore the Capitol was even cleared of rioters on January 6, some prominent Trump supporters started to try to deflect blame – claiming that left-wing Antifa, a loose collection of self-described anti-fascists, was actually behind the violence.\\nSuch “false flag” theories – that the violence was secretly orchestrated by Trump’s opponents in an attempt to make Trump look bad – never went away. And the theories have expanded to include claims that the violence was orchestrated by the Black Lives Matter movement or even by an arm of the federal government itself, the FBI.\\nFox News host Tucker Carlson has promoted false flag theories, focusing on the FBI, both in his own remarks and in his revisionist documentary series on a Fox streaming service in November. Carlson has claimed on his show that government documents showed that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on January 6.” Former Army Capt. Emily Rainey said in the documentary (and in a trailer Carlson tweeted out): “It is my opinion that false flags have happened in this country, one of which may have been January 6.”\\nAnd Trump himself has given oxygen to the theories, claiming in a December interview with ring-wing commentator Candace Owens, “You have BLM and you had Antifa people, I have very little doubt about that, and they were antagonizing and they were agitating.”\\nFacts First: The insurrection at the Capitol was not a false flag. Just as it looked on January 6, a mob of diehard Trump supporters stormed the building. They did so after Trump urged supporters to come to Washington and then, as we noted above, made a speech urging them to “fight like hell” and to march to the Capitol. The rioters’ allegiance to Trump has been exhaustively documented in court proceedings and in their social media posts and media interviews.\\nThough there are thousands of pages of court documents stemming from criminal cases against January 6 rioters, no Capitol riot defendant as of the end of 2021 had any confirmed involvement in Antifa or Black Lives Matter groups. (One defendant who filmed the riot had expressed support for Black Lives Matter but was disavowed in 2020 by BLM activists, some of whom suspected he was a provocateur connected to the political right.) By contrast, hundreds of Capitol riot defendants were confirmed to be Trump supporters – and some were members of far-right extremist groups. Members of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys have been charged with conspiracy regarding January 6; some have pleaded guilty.\\nCarlson wrongly described the court documents he inaccurately claimed were a smoking gun about FBI operatives organizing the attack; you can read more about that claim here. While it is entirely possible that some of the Capitol rioters were secretly serving as informants for the FBI – The New York Times reported in October that a member of the Proud Boys who had entered the Capitol on January 6 was an FBI informant – the presence of a few FBI informants among the estimated 2,000-plus people who illegally breached the Capitol would not make the entire mob assault an FBI-orchestrated “false flag” operation.\\nRepublican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, vice chair of the House select committee investigating the insurrection, said on Fox News in November that there is no truth to claims that January 6 was a false flag perpetrated by “deep state” liberals trying to set up Trump supporters.\\n“It’s the same kind of thing that you hear from people who say that 9/11 was an inside job, for example.

While all of you thought there was some kind of legitimate count going on here in Philadelphia, it was totally illegitimate.”\\nGiuliani’s team has also launched a lawsuit in Wisconsin, where he says that, after election observers had gone home, “at 3 or 4 in the morning about 120,000 ballots appeared . . . and they all got counted.”\\nThe Trump campaign also filed a lawsuit in Michigan Wednesday, with campaign manager Bill Stepien claiming Republican observers were denied “meaningful access to numerous counting locations to observe the opening of ballots and the counting process, as guaranteed by Michigan law.”\\nThere are other allegations of fraud or irregularities, late-counted votes and suspected vote harvesting being reported around the country.\\nIn one case, a woman claiming to be an election volunteer in Michigan’s Clark County claimed on video she had discovered a box of 500 ballots outside the counting facility from people who were not on the voter rolls.\\nIn Wisconsin, 300 ballots went missing when the Willow Township municipal clerk went home sick and no one could find her, the Washington Post reported. The ballots eventually turned up yesterday, with 157 votes for Trump and 114 for Biden.\\nIn Arizona — which was called early for Biden on election night, but the Trump campaign still says they can win — a “data error” claimed that 95 percent of votes had been counted yesterday when only 86 percent had been, and the remainder reportedly were from Trump-heavy counties.\\nSo you can see that, in such a close election, Trump’s concerns are not frivolous.\\nFraud is corrosive, but so is claiming fraud where there is none. We will see where the lawsuits land.\\nIn any case, Biden as much as declared victory yesterday, saying that by the time the count is finished, “I believe I will be the winner . . . we are winning in enough states to reach the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.”\\nTrump’s campaign claimed Wednesday he still had a path to victory if he keeps Pennsylvania and somehow Arizona comes back to him.\\nBut even if Trump does lose, it may be a blessing in disguise for Republicans.\\nThe result has crushed Democratic expectations of a clean sweep. It wasn’t a landslide win against an unpopular president, as we had been told so confidently for months.\\nIf Biden wins, it will be by the narrowest margin.\\nAnd all the hundreds of millions spent on retaking the Senate came to nothing, with the Republicans looking to hold onto their lead. The top targets, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Lindsey \\xadGraham, survived easily.\\nThe fatal miscalculations of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in cynically refusing to negotiate on the latest stimulus bill have cost the Democrats dearly in the House, where they have gone backward by at least six seats. They did not manage to get rid of a single Republican. So much for the blue wave.\\nThe failure means that in 2022, the House is more likely to revert to Republican control, setting up a lame-duck presidency.\\nThe Democrats won’t be able to pack the Supreme Court, abolish the Electoral College or make DC and Puerto Rico states. They will struggle to impose the Green New Deal.\\nUnfortunately, nothing can be done to stop a President Biden-Harris repeat of the geopolitical errors of the Obama presidency, such as appeasing China and Iran’s mullahs and signing onto the Paris climate accord.\\nBut a President Biden in cognitive decline will sooner or later be replaced by his unpopular, untested vice president, Kamala Harris.\\nSaddled with a recession and policies that will only exacerbate economic decline, the next four years will hobble Democrats.\\nTheir flaws and hypocrisy will be on full display, with a good chance of the 2024 presidential race being won by one of the new generation of Republican heirs to Trumpism.\\nWhoever wins this election, the result is a humiliation for the Trump-deranged media and the tame pollsters who provide them with the justification for their dishonest political narrative.\\nLet history record that on the Sunday before the election, the New York Times declared that “all 15” of their columnists suffer from mandatory Trump Derangement Syndrome.\\n“All 15 of our columnists explain what the past four years have cost America” was the introduction to a carnival of wokesplaining.\\nThat’s what you get when you fire opinion editors who publish conservatives.\\nWhoever wins, this election has exposed the frauds and liars who pose as our elites, and half of America won’t forget it.'], 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-passports-fbi-search-mar-a-lago/': ['cbscom', 'Trump passports taken in FBI search of Mar-a-Lago returned to former president', 'Melissa Quinn, Robert Legare', datetime.datetime(2022, 8, 16, 13, 12), 'Washington — Passports belonging to former President Donald Trump that were taken by the FBI during the search conducted at his South Florida residence last week have been returned to the former president, a law enforcement source confirmed to CBS News.\\nThe source said the passports were given back to Trump after they were discovered by a \"filter team,\" a group of federal investigators who screen the materials seized during the execution of a search warrant for privileged or extraneous information.\\nThe FBI said in a statement that when executing search warrants, the bureau \"follows search and seizure procedures ordered by courts, then returns items that we do not need to be retained for law enforcement purposes.\"\\nIn a post around 1:30 p.m. ET Monday on Truth Social, the former president\\'s social media platform, Trump claimed the FBI \"stole\" three passports, one of which he said was expired, when agents conducted the search of Mar-a-Lago last week.\\n\"This was an assault on a political opponent at a level never seen before in our country,\" he wrote. \"Third World!\"\\nSeveral hours later, Taylor Budowich, a spokesman for Trump, shared on Twitter an email the former president\\'s lawyers received from Jay Bratt, a top Justice Department official, alerting them that the passports had been taken and would be returned.\\n\"We have learned that the filter agents seized three passports belonging to President Trump, two expired and one being his active diplomatic passport.

Thanks, Obama.\", 'Senior White House Correspondent', datetime.datetime(2018, 10, 1, 23, 8, 15), 'Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images\\nWASHINGTON ― With critical elections approaching, President Donald Trump on Monday declared a rebranded trade deal with Mexico and Canada a major victory for himself ― even though it relies on key elements negotiated by his predecessor, President Barack Obama, for an agreement Trump had called a disaster.\\n“Throughout the campaign I promised to renegotiate NAFTA, and today we have kept that promise,” Trump said of his update to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he described as the “incredible new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement called USMCA.”\\nAdvertisement\\nBut the majority of the “new” items in the deal announced late Sunday were negotiated over a period of years by the Obama administration as part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That agreement included a dozen nations in the Americas, Southeast Asia, Japan and Australia, reducing trade barriers and increasing environmental and labor standards.\\nIn fact, at least half of the men and women standing behind Trump during his Rose Garden ceremony praising the new deal were the same career service staff who negotiated nearly identical provisions in TPP, which Trump had railed against.\\n“Ironically, he called them horrible negotiators when running for office,” said Trevor Kincaid, the spokesman for the United States Trade Representative’s office under Obama, adding that the USTR team was first-rate then and remains first-rate today. “It’s really the same with a new name. It’s basically the ‘22 Jump Street’ of trade deals.”\\nJared Bernstein, formerly Vice President Joe Biden’s top economic adviser, said he likes some of the pro-labor changes in the new deal, but added that Trump’s characterization of the agreement as a dramatic change from NAFTA is absurd.\\nAdvertisement\\n“It’s not the slightest bit credible to argue that NAFTA or TPP were massive disasters but that USMCA is perfection,” Bernstein said, adding that the claim fits into Trump’s playbook. “You create a period of disruption and chaos. You bring it to a close. And you declare victory regardless of the outcome.”\\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump criticized TPP as the worst deal ever negotiated (a description that he also applied to NAFTA and the Iran nuclear deal), and withdrew from it promptly after taking office.\\nBecause both Canada and Mexico were also covered by TPP, it effectively would have replaced NAFTA had Trump and Congress approved it. It also would have included Japan ― with which Trump has unsuccessfully sought an agreement ― and, many trade experts said at the time, would have served as a check on China’s growing dominance in the western Pacific.\\nIt is unclear whether Trump understands or cares that many of the elements in his new “USMCA” were present earlier in TPP. On Monday, Trump said: “This one is a brand-new deal.”\\nNevertheless, the provisions of the agreement dealing with online commerce and intellectual property protections, for example, were included in TPP and are now in Trump’s USMCA, largely unchanged.\\nAdvertisement\\n“To some degree, we have wasted our time by redoing what was in the Pacific trade deal,” said James Pethokoukis, a trade expert at the American Enterprise Institute. “There’s a lot of overlap.”\\nEven the issue that Trump called a “deal breaker” ― Canada’s protectionist policies for its dairy farmers ― was resolved in the new deal in the same manner it was resolved in TPP. Canada agreed to open a small percentage of its market to U.S. dairy farmers for certain products. But because that small percentage will be almost entirely for American dairy operators, not split among 11 countries, the new deal will likely be a modest improvement for U.S. dairy farmers compared to TPP.\\nOne significant change to both NAFTA and TPP involves the rules regarding automobile manufacture. NAFTA currently requires 62.5 percent of a car’s value to be made in North America to move across borders tariff-free. The revised deal would increase that to 75 percent, and would require that at least 40 percent of the labor for the car be paid no less than $16 an hour.\\nBernstein, who is now a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said those new rules could help American workers by reducing the incentives for U.S. automakers to build new plants outside North America, and by reducing the wage differential between the United States and Mexico.\\n“That’s potentially a beneficial change,” he said, adding that it would depend on how it was implemented and enforced.\\nAdvertisement\\nFor any of that to happen, however, Congress will have to approve the agreement. Trump said Monday he would sign the deal by the end of November. It would then go to Capitol Hill, which at that point could be in the throes of switching from Republican control, at least in the House, to Democratic.\\nIf Congress does not approve the new trade pact, the existing NAFTA would remain in place ― at least until Trump carried out the formal process of withdrawing from it, which might also require congressional approval.'], 'https://www.dailywire.com/news/chris-wallace-faces-intense-backlash-including-from-colleagues-over-bias-during-debate': ['dailywire.com', 'Chris Wallace Faces Intense Backlash, Including From Colleagues, Over Bias During Debate', '', datetime.datetime(2020, 9, 30, 2, 25, 51), \"Fox News host Chris Wallace, a registered Democrat, faced intense backlash on Tuesday night for what was widely deemed as bias in the debate in the favor of Democrat Joe Biden and against Republican President Donald Trump.\\nOne of the issues that Wallace was called out for the most was how he appeared to let Biden interrupt Trump but would jump in to interrupt Trump when Trump would talk over Biden.\\nFox News host Brian Kilmeade even noted the discrepancy and called it out on social media, writing: “Why is @JoeBiden allowed to interrupt? @realDonaldTrump is not.”\\nWhy is @JoeBiden allowed to interrupt? @realDonaldTrump is not — Brian Kilmeade (@kilmeade) September 30, 2020\\nFox News host Laura Ingraham made a similar point, writing: “Biden seems to interrupt with impunity.”\\nBiden seems to interrupt with impunity. — Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) September 30, 2020\\nFox News contributor Andy McCarthy wrote: “I love Chris Wallace, but he should get out of the way.”\\nI love Chris Wallace, but he should get out of the way. — Andy McCarthy (@AndrewCMcCarthy) September 30, 2020\\nMcCarthy added: “Biden doesn’t support the Green New Deal.

The objective, according to people close to Donald Trump, is twofold: “deterrence,” as Chief of Staff John Kelly explained last month, and political extortion. “The thinking in the building is to force people to the table,” a White House official told The Washington Post last week.

Instead of ending the controversial policy, however, President Trump has promoted a contradictory and confusing message about family separation. At times, he has blamed Democrats for what he has described as their “law” (it is not a law); at others, he has suggested that family separation is indeed his policy, but that Democrats have forced him to take action by not agreeing to new immigration-reform legislation. In a series of tweets Monday morning, he wrote that it is “the Democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with Boarder [sic] Security and Crime” and called on Congress to “change the laws.” He also indicated that the policy is driven by racial or cultural concerns, describing migrant children as Trojan horses for “the worst criminals on earth” and declaring that the U.S. should not repeat Europe’s “big mistake” of “allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture.”\\nTwitter content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\\nOver the weekend and into Monday, a number of Trump officials made similar obfuscations about the policy. In every instance, however, the implication was clear: the problem could go away if Democrats will just play ball. “This is up to the Democrats. They could fix this right now. If you close those loopholes, we could do this humanely,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley said during an interview with Fox & Friends on Monday, before accusing Democrats of bolstering drug cartels and the “child-smuggling industry.” Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway similarly put the onus on Congress to address the crisis at the border during an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday. After asserting that “nobody likes this policy,” Conway said, “If the Democrats are serious, and if a lot of Republicans are serious, they’ll come together. They won’t just talk about just this week, just the Dreamers, or just the wall, or just catch and release. It’s all of the above,” she said.

North Korea released three American hostages.\\nPresident Trump has been more successful dealing with North Korea in one year than the U.S. has been in the last 30 years.\\nThe summit is only an important first step.\\nBut we must remember that six months ago, nuclear war seemed plausible, as the threats and rhetoric escalated. Those days now seem to be behind us.\\nThe U.S. must continue to protect its own security, and our strong allies South Korea and Japan, and that requires steadfast leadership in holding the line on economic sanctions and U.S. troop deployment until the nuclear threat is verifiably and irreversibly neutralized.\\nThe first step is for North Korea to inventory its entire nuclear program. Without this step, inspections are meaningless. Once that inventory is offered, the U.S. needs a system of snap inspections, with no sites exempted. As North Korea takes these meaningful steps, with South Korea also moving on a timeline toward denuclearization, the U.S. can commit to removing sanctions over time, considering scaling down U.S. troops in South Korea, and starting formal diplomatic relations with North Korea.\\nThere are other important issues. Their medium range ballistic missile capability worries Japan. Japan has dozens of hostages being held in North Korea. Tens of thousands of North Koreans are held in prison camps, making it one of the worst human rights abusers in the world. Every one of these issues is important.\\nBut the Trump administration is wise to focus their full and immediate attention on ending the nuclear threat.\\nThe two sides are now publicly talking to each other. Wars are less likely when both sides are talking.\\nIt took Ronald Reagan several years and five meetings with Mikhail Gorbachev to strike a deal with the Soviet Union.\\nA comprehensive agreement is complicated, and relationships take time to build.\\nWhile establishment analysts and bureaucrats have criticized President Trump at every step, the result up to this point should be reassuring to all Americans.\\nThere is much work still to be done. The details here matter greatly.\\nBut President Trump deserves credit for overseeing the maximum pressure campaign, which forced Chairman Kim to the table. Now that they have met, Mr. Trump has the kind of opportunity he relishes more than any other: Striking a deal.\\n• Matt Mackowiak is president of Austin, Texas, and Washington, D.C.-based Potomac Strategy Group.

And that’s not a policy statement,” Comey said.\\n“He is morally unfit to be president,” he added.\\nComey has a tell-all book, “A Higher Loyalty,” due out on Tuesday.\\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\\nThe book’s imminent release - and the slated ABC News interview - prompted Trump to hurl a new set of insults at Comey earlier on Sunday, challenging accusations made in the book, and insisting that he never pressed Comey to be loyal to him.\\n“Slippery James Comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!), will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!” Trump wrote early on Sunday in one of five Twitter posts aimed directly at Comey.\\nReuters and other news outlets have obtained copies of Comey’s book before its formal release. In it, Comey wrote that Trump, in a private meeting, pressed the then-FBI director for his loyalty.\\nComey told ABC News that the title of the book came from that “bizarre conversation” he had with Trump at the White House in January 2017, shortly after his inauguration.\\n“He asked for my loyalty personally as the F.B.I. director. My loyalty’s supposed to be to the American people and to the institution,” Comey said in the interview.\\nThe FBI has long tried to operate as an independent law enforcement agency.\\n“I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies,” Trump said on Twitter.\\nComey is now a crucial witness for Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether Trump has tried to obstruct the Russia probe.\\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\\nComey told ABC News that he believes there is “certainly some evidence of obstruction of justice.”\\nComey also defended his decision to publicly disclose the FBI’s re-opening of its investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s handling of email when she was secretary of state.\\nThe Clinton probe was already public, Comey said, whereas the FBI’s examination of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia was in its early stages. It did not become publicly known until after the 2016 presidential election.\\nDespite his myriad of reservations about Trump, Comey told ABC News that he did not believe the U.S. Congress should impeach him, as it would let the American people “off the hook” for something “they’re duty bound to do directly.”\\n“People in this country need to stand up and go to the voting booth and vote their values,” he said.\\nU.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, interviewed on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday morning, expressed qualified support for Comey. Asked whether Comey was a man of integrity, the Republican speaker said: “As far as I know,” but added that he did not know him well.\\nAsked about Trump’s use last week of the words “slime ball” to describe Comey, Ryan said: “I don’t use words like that.”\\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said the ABC interview reaffirms that Comey’s “higher loyalty is to himself.”\\n“He has no credibility and President Trump was right to follow through on the bipartisan calls for him to be fired,” McDaniel said in a statement.\\n(Refiles to add dropped article “A” from book title, paragraph 9.)'], 'https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/11/13/donald-trump-jim-acosta-222463': ['politico.com', 'Donald Trump and Jim Acosta, a Love Story', 'Jack Shafer, Jeremy B. White, Sam Sutton, Carly Sitrin, Bill Mahoney, Josh Gerstein', datetime.datetime(2018, 11, 13, 4, 1), \"John Moore/Getty Images Fourth Estate Donald Trump and Jim Acosta, a Love Story The fakest news in town is that the president is mad at a preening TV reporter who’s great for ratings.\\nJack Shafer is Politico’s senior media writer.\\nIf CNN reporter Jim Acosta is such a troublous force inside the White House Briefing Room—a “rude, terrible person” as President Donald Trump recently put it—deserving of being banned from White House grounds, then why did Trump and press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders routinely call on him during the televised question and answer periods at the White House over the past 22 months?\\nHad Acosta’s behavior truly offended them, Sanders and Trump could have permanently stifled the pesky reporter by treating him like a ghost, averting their gazes and picking other reporters during question time. Acosta couldn’t have done anything about it. Instead, Sanders and Trump regularly called on Acosta, counting on the likelihood that he would do that Acosta thing of speechifying and playing microphone hog as he attempts to turn a question into an extended back-and-forth. Sanders and Trump have pretended exasperation at Acosta’s posturing—posturing that hasn’t broken much news, by the way—but not so secretly they happily wallow in his pomposity. By getting Acosta to play the preening, self-aggrandizing, sanctimonious reporter and using him as the punching bag for the White House’s anti-press strategy, Sanders and Trump have created a unique public venue to exhibit their hatred for the “fake news” of CNN.\\nThe TV moments created by Acosta's clashes—see the Guardian's reel of their best sparring matches—have served him, too. If you’re a fan of reporters who are better at lecturing than asking a question and think White House briefings and presidential press conferences should resemble the bloodsport of duels, then you probably find the Acosta clashes sufficiently enriching to make CNN your cable news destination.\\nAcosta’s forced exile and the lawsuit filed by CNN today demanding that Sanders and Trump return the “hard pass” that will allow him to roam the White House grounds have turned him into a free speech martyr, which I suppose he is. Like all First Amendment radicals, I deplore the Acosta ban and look forward to the day that he’s back in the White House making a pest of himself again. The case law cited in the suit by lawyer Theodore J. Boutrous, a top cock in the First Amendment bar’s pecking order, appears to prevent the White House from arbitrarily banning reporters from White House press facilities “for less than compelling reasons.” Even Fox News Channel’s legal analyst Andrew Napolitano predicts that the matter will be resolved “quickly“ in CNN’s favor.\\nThe original charge Sanders made when barring Acosta—that he had placed “his hands” on the White House intern trying to retrieve his microphone during the presser—has been disproved. Today, attempting to argue against the CNN suit, Sanders shifted her rationale for the de-Acostafication of the White House, accusing him additionally and accurately for not surrendering the microphone when approached by the intern.\\nBut as Sanders herself acknowledges, this was not the first time Acosta had resisted yielding the floor. So where is the common justice in ejecting him from White House grounds without so much as a warning? Sanders and Trump have thrilled in Acosta’s bad manners not only because his acting out helped personify their critique of CNN but also because it has made great TV drama for the president. Anything that’s good for ratings is good with Trump. It’s obvious from viewing the Acosta-Trump faceoff that Trump was spoiling for a fight—“Here we go,” Trump interrupted as Acosta began the wind-up on his first question—and started swinging back from the get-go. He wanted what Acosta was bringing so he could re-assume his old reality-TV role as the heavy who banishes the pretentious upstart. When the CNN lawsuit rolled in today, Trump must have clicked his heels in joy at the prospect of kicking Acosta and CNN around some more.\\nTelevised White House briefings have always been political theater but under Trump’s management they’ve generated as much genuine news as a low-wattage kitchen microwave. The endless bickering between Sanders and the press corps and her obfuscations have become the story, much to the detriment of journalism. I wouldn’t go so far to call the briefings useless—they can connect reporters to otherwise hard-to-find facts and get the administration on the record—but for real news you have to rely on reporters like Maggie Haberman who spend little time in the daily briefings waiting for news to arrive.\\nLike so many episodes of The Trump Show, the martyrdom of Jim Acosta provides an entertaining sideshow. While it’s true that he’s more of a pain in the neck than a true newshawk, we can still call for his return to the White House briefing room in good conscience because being a pain in the neck is often a necessary part of the job. Besides, Sanders and Trump already miss him.\\n******\\nDoes the briefing room emit low-level radiation like a kitchen microwave or is it more like an afterschool special for shut-ins?

That\\'s especially true in areas of the country that typically vote for Republican candidates, like farming communities in the Midwest, according to one recent study by economists from UCLA, University of California, Berkeley, Columbia University and the World Bank.\\n\"The economic evidence to date on this is exactly the opposite of Trump\\'s statement,\" Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and host of the podcast TradeTalks tweeted. \"The impact of the 2018 tariffs has been passed on to U.S. consumers in the form of higher prices. China is NOT bearing the burden of Trump\\'s tariffs.\"\\nCompanies, not countries, pay tariffs\\nMr. Trump said via Twitter that negotiations with China are progressing \"too slowly,\" and he threatened to jack up tariffs on $325 billion in Chinese goods to 25 percent -- that would effectively impose a tariff on all Chinese products that enter the U.S.\\nAs a result, American business that import items from China would face potentially higher costs. Tariffs are a tax that companies -- not countries -- pay on imported goods, for raw materials, parts and finished products. Companies facing higher costs for imports often pass those on to consumers in the form of higher prices. At the same time, the cost of goods the U.S. exports overseas may rise.\\nPricier washers and dryers\\nTake washing machines. Washers imported to U.S. were one of the first products to be subject to higher U.S. tariffs last year under the Trump administration\\'s protectionist trade stance. Washing machine prices rose 12 percent for U.S. consumers as foreign makers couldn\\'t shift production to other countries.\\nRetailers also raised the price of dryers by the same amount even though they weren\\'t subject to tariffs, a separate study from economists from the University of Chicago and Federal Reserve found. In total, over the course of a year U.S. consumers ended up forking out an additional $1.5 billion to buy washers and dryers. That came to between $82 and $92 per appliance.\\n$3 billion in higher costs\\nAnother study released this spring by economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Columbia University and Princeton University found that the burden of Mr. Trump\\'s tariffs fell entirely on U.S. consumers and businesses that buy imported products. By the end of last year, companies were paying $3 billion a month in higher tariffs and absorbing $1.4 billion a month in higher costs. The researchers noted \"that U.S. producers responded to reduced import competition by raising their prices.\"\\nNotably, tariffs have barely grazed the $22 trillion U.S. economy, which continues grow at a steady clip. Without tariffs, though, the expansion would be even bigger, the UCLA-led group of economists suggested.\\nRepublican counties \"bore the brunt\"\\nChina and other countries fired back when Mr. Trump\\'s tariffs took effect last year, both through retaliatory tariffs and shunning some U.S. exports altogether, like soybeans. That\\'s exacerbating already difficult conditions in America\\'s farming regions -- typically heavily Republican voting areas. The European Union taxed motorcycle exports, prompting Harley Davidson to open a factory in Europe rather than build them in the U.S. to ship overseas.\\n\"Workers in very Republican counties bore the brunt of the costs of the trade war, in part because retaliations disproportionately targeted agricultural sectors,\" researchers wrote in the UCLA-led study. When combined with protectionist policies that shielded some U.S. companies from competitive imports, the U.S. economy lost an estimated $7.8 billion because of the tariffs imposed on China and other countries last year.'], 'https://www.npr.org/2019/11/12/776556916/daca-recipients-look-to-supreme-court-for-hope': ['npr', 'DACA Recipients Look To Supreme Court For Hope', 'Nina Totenberg', datetime.datetime(2019, 11, 12, 5, 0), 'DACA Recipients Look To Supreme Court For Hope\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP Carolyn Kaster/AP\\nThe U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments Tuesday in a highly anticipated set of cases that threatens the legal status of some 700,000 young immigrants — often called DREAMers — who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. It\\'s a program that President Trump tried to rescind seven months after taking office, only to have the lower courts block his action.\\nIn 2012, President Barack Obama put the program in place to temporarily protect these young people from deportation. If you were in school, were a high school graduate, or had been honorably discharged from the military, and if you passed a background check, you were eligible for temporary legal status and a work permit, renewable every two years. The program is formally known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.\\n\"Rest easy\"\\nPresident Trump, from the beginning, seemed conflicted about DACA, caught between the mass deportations he promised his political base during the campaign and his admiration for what so many of the DREAMers have accomplished.\\nThese DACA recipients, who come from around the world, have become teachers, psychologists, business owners and doctors.\\nTheir successes illustrate the reason that Republicans and Democrats in Congress tried to work out a DACA deal that Trump would sign in 2017. \"Rest easy,\" Trump told the DREAMers in an April 2017 interview with The Associated Press.\\nTrump \"kept waffling back and forth\"\\nBut he \"kept waffling back and forth over what he would be willing to accept, and wouldn\\'t be willing to accept,\" in terms of a DACA deal, says Julie Hirschfeld Davis, co-author of Border Wars and congressional editor for The New York Times.\\nAt the end of the day, Trump\\'s indecision was so frustrating for Senate Republican leaders that they worked out a compromise with Democrats on their own. Just hours before the deal was to come up for a vote on the Senate floor, however, the administration branded it unacceptable in a midnight press release, according to Davis.\\nShortly thereafter, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the DACA program would end because, he said, it was illegal and unconstitutional to begin with.\\n\"They are dead wrong ...\"\\n\"They are dead wrong when they say that the DACA program adopted by the Obama administration was illegal,\" says Ted Olson, who served as solicitor general in the George W. Bush administration and is representing DACA plaintiffs in the Supreme Court.\\nOlson points to programs similar to DACA that were put in place by every other president dating back to Dwight Eisenhower. These programs granted temporary legal status, for instance, to 600,000 Cubans in the 1950s and \\'60s and 1.5 million other undocumented immigrants under another program in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations.\\nJanet Napolitano was secretary at the Department Homeland Security when DACA was created. \"Not only is there a long history of deferring action for particular groups under the immigration laws,\" says Napolitano, \"but there\\'s the whole concept of prosecutorial discretion, which gives the executive branch the authority to make decisions about who is going to feel the full brunt of the federal government in an enforcement proceeding, versus not.\"\\nProsecutorial discretion vs. \"complete suspension of the law\"\\n\"The Supreme Court has long recognized that there may be a line between prosecutorial discretion, not enforcing the law in every instance, and a complete suspension of the law,\" counters John Eastman, a constitutional law professor at Chapman University who has filed a brief siding with the Trump administration in the DACA case.\\nEastman maintains that DACA is different from other, similar programs in prior administrations, citing DACA recipients\\' benefits — including work authorization, Social Security benefits and tax credits on tax returns — as different from prior administrations.\\nNapolitano replies that granting temporary legal status to DACA recipients enables them to work, and when they work, they must pay into Social Security and pay taxes.\\nIndeed, government statistics indicate that some 91% of DACA recipients have jobs, allowing them to support their families and generating, over a 10-year period, nearly $60 billion in federal tax revenue that the government stands to lose if the DACA program is abolished.\\nIs this illegally arbitrary?\\nNapolitano is no longer DHS secretary. She is the president of the giant University of California system, including 1,700 students with DACA status. And in that capacity, she is challenging Trump\\'s revocation of the DACA program as so arbitrary and unsupported by stated reasons and data that the revocation is itself illegal.\\n\"If they had done a full policy review and had set forth all their reasons and demonstrated that they had weighed the pros and cons and just came to a different conclusion, they might be able to prevail in this case,\" says Napolitano. \"But they didn\\'t do that. Instead they just simply issued basically a one-sentence order that said since DACA is illegal or was illegal, we\\'re going to undo it.\"\\nSometimes lost in all the legal discussion are the people whose lives will be affected by the Supreme Court\\'s decision in the DACA case. DACA recipient Mitchell Santos Toledo, brought to the U.S. when he was 2 and now in his last year at Harvard Law School, remembers crying when he received his Social Security card. \"This is home for us. It\\'s not a place I call home. It is home,\" he says.\\nA first-of-its-kind video friend of the court brief filed by United We Dream seeks to highlight other DACA stories. \"We got DACA and it\\'s like we got wings.

I decided to become a teacher so that students could have that role model,\" says Maricruz R.\\nPublic support for DACA is illustrated by a distinct imbalance in friend of the court briefs filed in the case. Six have been filed supporting the administration\\'s position. They include briefs filed by conservative organizations and individuals and a brief filed by 12 Republican-dominated states.\\nA total of 35 briefs have been filed in support of DACA. Among them are briefs filed by higher education associations, health professionals and even briefs filed by more than 145 corporations and business organizations arguing that if the court were to side with the Trump administration and abolish DACA, their companies and industries would be significantly disrupted.\\nA decision on DACA is expected by summer, just as the 2020 election is kicking into high gear. Republicans in Congress may be hoping that the high court will let them off the hook and rule in favor of DACA.\\nWhether the current Supreme Court, dominated by conservative justices inclined to defer to presidential power, fulfills those hopes, however, remains to be seen.'], 'https://reason.com/2019/11/11/why-daca-is-legal/': ['reason.com', 'Why DACA Is Legal', 'Ilya Somin, Joe Lancaster, David Mcgarry, Eric Boehm, Jacob Sullum, Emma Camp', datetime.datetime(2019, 11, 11, 23, 8, 27), 'Tomorrow, the Supreme Court will hear three consolidated cases challenging the Trump administration\\'s decision to rescind DACA, an Obama administration policy suspending deportation of some 800,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. DACA allows such migrants (often referred to as \"dreamers,\" after the Dream Act, which failed to pass Congress) to stay in the U.S. as long as they arrived in the country when they were 15 years old or younger, were 30 or younger when the program began in 2012, have not been convicted of any crimes as of the time they apply for the program, and have either graduated from a U.S. high school, are currently enrolled in school, or have served in the armed forces.\\nAs co-blogger Josh Blackman (a longtime critic of the legality of DACA) points out, the Trump administration\\'s position in these cases relies heavily on the notion that DACA had to be rescinded because it is itself illegal. For political reasons, the president did not want to give the impression that he actually favors deporting the Dreamers (which would be an extremely unpopular position). Thus, he decided to hide behind the theory that his hands are tied by legal considerations. As Josh recognizes with admirable candor, this framing of the issue makes the administration\\'s policy \"nearly impossible to defend.\" I agree, with one slight modification: If this really is the only justification, I would strike out the \"nearly\" in that sentence.\\nWhile the president\\'s motives for relying on this argument were probably political, I don\\'t doubt that many conservatives, including some administration officials, sincerely believe that DACA is illegal. But, regardless of the reasons for putting it forward, the claim that DACA is illegal is badly wrong. I summarized the reasons why in a 2017 post from which much of what follows is adapted:\\nQuite simply, DACA is within the scope of presidential authority because it does not change the law, and does not legalize anything that would otherwise be illegal, without specific authorization from Congress.\\nCritics attack DACA on the grounds that Obama lacked legal authority to choose not to enforce the law in this case. This critique runs afoul of the reality that the federal government already chooses not to enforce its laws against the vast majority of those who violate them. Current federal criminal law is so expansive that the majority of Americans are probably federal criminals.\\nThat includes whole categories of people who get away with violating federal law because the president and the Justice Department believe that going after them isn\\'t worth the effort, and possibly morally dubious. For example, the feds almost never go after the hundreds of thousands of college students who are guilty of using illegal drugs in their dorms.\\nJohn Yoo contends that there is a difference between using \"prosecutorial discretion\" to \"choose priorities and prosecute cases that are the most important\" and \"refusing to enforce laws because of disagreements over policy.\" But that distinction makes little sense. Policy considerations are inevitably among the criteria by which presidents and prosecutors \"choose priorities\" and decide which cases are \"the most important.\"\\nOne reason the federal government has not launched a crackdown on illegal drug use in college dorms is precisely because they think it would be bad policy, and probably unjust to boot. It did not even do that during the reign of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the hard-core drug warrior who also initiated the rescission of DACA on the grounds that the program exceeds the bounds of executive discretion.\\nYoo and others also argue that prosecutorial discretion does not allow the president to refuse to enforce an \"entire law,\" as opposed to merely doing so in specific cases. But Obama has not in fact refused to enforce the entire relevant law requiring deportation of illegal immigrants. He has simply chosen to do so with respect to people who fit certain specified criteria that the vast majority of undocumented migrants do not meet.'], 'https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2022/august/coordinated-attack-by-democrats-trump-responds-to-fbi-raid-on-mar-a-lago-allies-urge-run-in-2024': ['www1.cbn.com', \"'Coordinated Attack by Democrats': Trump Responds to FBI Raid on Mar-a-Lago, Allies Urge Run in 2024\", '', datetime.datetime(2022, 8, 10, 14, 45), 'Republicans are up in arms over the FBI\\'s raid of President Trump\\'s home, and they\\'re pressuring the Department of Justice to explain the reasons for the search.

A ruling on the DACA program is expected next spring in the midst of the 2020 presidential election.\\nWhat\\'s DACA? DACA, \"Dreamers,\" TPS? Who are they, what do they have to do with Trump, the wall and the shutdown?\\nIn Austin, where Texas state officials brought the original challenge to both DACA and an ill-fated effort by President Barack Obama to extend similar protections to 4 million undocumented parents, Pedro Villalobos\\' job as an assistant county attorney is at risk.\\nThe state argues in court papers that \"Congress has never given the executive carte blanche to grant lawful presence to any alien it chooses not to remove, let alone benefits including work authorization, health care, unemployment, and a pathway to citizenship.\"\\nSeated in a county courtroom he uses regularly to prosecute crime, Villalobos, 28, said a defeat at the Supreme Court \"would end my service to this community.\"\\n\"I represent the state, but the state doesn\\'t represent me,\" he said.\\nKaren Reyes, a pre-kindergarten special-education teacher, has timed her two-year DACA renewal to next year\\'s Christmas holiday season so that if it isn\\'t granted, the school system can replace her without interruption.\\n\"We are living our lives two years at a time,\" Reyes, 31, said, despite the fact that \"I have not even a parking ticket to my name.\"\\nVanessa Rodriguez, the youngest of the group at 21, has put her plans beyond graduating from the University of Texas on hold because her work permit could disappear along with DACA.\\n\"Part of being undocumented is knowing that you have to plan,\" she said. \"Will I be able to fund myself through the next phase of my life?\"\\nSurgeons and Rhodes scholars\\nThe three cases on the high court\\'s docket, consolidated from among many others, are significant for several reasons:\\n• They represent a major separation-of-powers wrestling match between the executive and legislative branches of government. Obama created the program without input from Congress. With Texas leading the way, the Trump administration argues that was illegal.\\n\"As attorney general, my purview is law and the Constitution,\" Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote in USA TODAY last year. \"No president has the power to change the law simply because he is upset that Congress failed to enact his favored legislation. Such behavior is not only petulant and childish, but more importantly, it trashes the separation of powers, the very foundation of constitutional government.\"\\n• They constitute the third major immigration battle to reach the court in which the Trump administration has used shifting justifications for its actions. The court ultimately upheld President Donald Trump\\'s travel ban against several majority-Muslim nations last year but blocked his effort this year to put a citizenship question on the 2020 census.\\n• They advance the Trump administration\\'s effort to dismantle policies put in place by the Obama administration. The president has been unable to do away with the Affordable Care Act but was more successful in ending Obama\\'s Clean Power Plan, his signature climate change policy.\\n• Even if Trump wins, the victories may be but a bargaining chip in negotiations with Congress, in which he could offer to extend DACA protections in exchange for increased funding for a border wall with Mexico.\\nBut none of those reasons have attracted as much attention as the \"Dreamers\" themselves, many of whom came to America before they could walk or talk. About 80% of them are from Mexico. Nearly 10% more arrived from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Nearly 200,000 live in California, another 100,000 in Texas.\\nIncluded among them are Ivy League graduates and a Rhodes scholar from South Korea, an orthopedic surgeon and a Catholic priest.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, based in California and a continuing thorn in Trump\\'s side, ridiculed the effort to deport \"blameless and economically productive young people with clean criminal records.\"\\nThe Supreme Court\\'s willingness to hear the case signals a potential win for the White House, but how it wins would be crucial. If the justices say Trump has the same discretion to end the program that Obama had in creating it, a future president just as easily could renew it. If they agree with the Justice Department that it\\'s unlawful, Congress would have to step in.\\nOpposing the administration are lawyers representing California, New York, the District of Columbia and an array of \"Dreamers.\" Nearly three dozen legal briefs have been submitted on their side by groups representing big business, educators, religious institutions, labor unions, law enforcement and national security, along with immigration and civil rights organizations.\\n\"There is no dispute that this decision has life-changing implications for nearly 700,000 DACA participants and their families,\" the Regents of the University of California told the court.\\nThroughout the 2-year-old ordeal, the \"Dreamers\" have been their own best advocates. Scores of them set off two weeks ago to walk from New York City to Washington, D.C. Others are flying in from California, Texas and elsewhere to sit in court, demonstrate outside and lobby members of Congress.\\nAmong them will be Diego Corzo, who came from Peru 20 years ago at age 9.

FBI agents knew that the Steele dossier was unreliable and eventually learned that Steele\\'s sub-sources had contradicted what was in the report, but continued with the surveillance anyway.

Mike Lee (R–Utah), who has been one of the only Republicans willing to sound the alarm about the potential for the FBI to violate Americans\\' rights under the current legal regime. Sen. Ben Sasse (R–Neb.) admitted that Lee\\'s skepticism of the FISA courts now seems justified.\\nIt\\'s a shame that it took congressional Republicans so long to realize that empowering a vast and secretive bureaucracy to spy on people could easily go disastrously wrong—and it\\'s telling that they have only finally conceded the point because the abuses have been directed at Trump. Moreover, despite their sudden interest in reforming FISA, \"nearly all Rs joined most Ds today to reauthorize intelligence activities without reforms to protect Americans\\' rights,\" according to Rep. Justin Amash (I–Mich.). I\\'m glad some Republicans are apparently reconsidering their reflexive trust of the FBI, but clearly they still have a long way to go.\\nThat\\'s true as well for the mainstream media, which for far too long has given undeserved credit to Trump-critical law enforcement figures like former FBI Directors James Comey and Andrew McCabe. Both have been lionized on cable news and in newspapers. They were routinely labeled brave truth-tellers who took serious personal risks to call out wrongdoing within the administration.\\nMany of their criticisms of the Trump administration may have been well-founded. But under Comey\\'s watch, the FBI made major errors. Comey and McCabe were directly involved in the decision to rely on the Steele dossier—a decision that the CIA had serious concerns about. Comey later misled the public about the extent of the FBI\\'s reliance on the dossier. Indeed, many in the mainstream media had previously claimed that the dossier was not the only basis for the FBI\\'s interest in Page, because they uncritically believed what the G-men were telling them. We now know that\\'s wrong—the Steele dossier was the FBI\\'s key piece of evidence.\\nComey is still trying to spin the IG\\'s report as some kind of vindication. This is delusional and embarrassing. If the media learns anything from this episode, it should be that the fact that Team Trump has ostracized an insufficiently deferential public servant is not enough of a reason to embrace him as a hero and a savior.\\nThe IG report is a wakeup call: for Republicans who foolishly claimed the FBI\\'s secretive spying process was necessary and unthreatening, for anti-Trump media pundits who uncritically parroted the talking points of top officials, and for any Americans who still think it is worth trading away their liberties.

It does not give Trump the right to fund projects that Congress will not approve. Authoritarian leaders do that sort of thing. The puffed-up wannabe strongman now living in the White House is giving it a try.\\nAdvertisement\\nPresident Trump declared a national emergency to fund his border wall. Here are some of the challenges that could crop up to block his declaration. (Video: Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post, Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\\nLet’s be clear: There is no emergency. Arrests for illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border peaked in 2000, nearly two decades ago, at more than 1.5 million a year. They declined sharply under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama and, in 2017, were at their lowest point since 1971. In 2018, apprehensions ticked up slightly — but still barely climbed above 400,000.\\nThere has indeed been an increase in families presenting themselves at legal points of entry to seek asylum — those groups of bedraggled Central Americans that Trump calls “caravans.” Under U.S. and international law, these people have an undisputed right to ask for asylum and have their cases evaluated. Again, they come to legal border crossings to seek admission. Only a handful try to navigate the forbidding rural terrain where Trump says he wants to build a wall.\\nFollow Eugene Robinson \\'s opinions Follow\\nWhat the administration really needs to do is expand and improve facilities for processing, caring for and, when necessary, housing these asylum seekers. But Trump doesn’t care about doing the right thing, or even the necessary thing. He cares only about being able to claim he is following through on his vicious anti-immigration rhetoric, which brands Mexican would-be migrants as “rapists” and Central Americans as members of the MS-13 street gang.\\nAdvertisement\\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Feb. 14 that if President Trump makes a disaster declaration, it will be a \"tremendous mistake.\" (Video: U.S. Senate)\\nTrump had two years in which Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate — and could not persuade Congress to give him funding for a wall. He decided to make it an issue only after Democrats won the power to say no. The president’s negotiating strategy — pitching tantrums, walking away from the table, venting on Twitter, provoking the longest partial government shutdown in history — was never going to work. You might think he would have learned something about how Washington works by now, but you would be wrong.\\nBecause there obviously is no legitimate emergency, Trump’s declaration — and the shifting of resources from duly authorized projects to the wall — will surely be challenged in court. It is possible, if not likely, that any actual construction will be held up indefinitely.\\nIndeed, legal briefs arguing against Trump’s action practically write themselves. An emergency, by definition, is urgent. The 9/11 terrorist attacks, for example, clearly qualified as a national emergency. But Trump has been talking about issuing an emergency declaration to build the wall for a couple of months. If such action wasn’t necessary in December, some judge will surely ask, then why now?\\nAdvertisement\\nMoney for the wall will have to be taken from other projects, all of which have constituencies in Congress and among the public. Ranchers and others whose land would have to be taken by eminent domain for the wall will be up in arms.\\nPolitically, Trump carelessly put Republican senators in a tough spot. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) may have the House pass a resolution of disapproval, which the Senate would be compelled to take up. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and his caucus would have to decide whether to support a presidential power grab they know is unwise — or oppose Trump and risk the ire of the GOP base.\\nOne of the most strident Republican criticisms of Obama was that he took executive actions that should have been the purview of Congress. But this action by Trump goes much further and sets a dangerous precedent.\\nAdvertisement\\nWhat would keep the next Democratic president from declaring an emergency, in the wake of some mass shooting, and imposing a ban on assault weapons? Is that what McConnell wants as his legacy?\\nTrump cares only that his base is mollified. And that nobody remembers how Mexico was supposed to foot the bill.\\nRead more:\\nGiftOutline Gift Article'], 'http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/will-comey-bombshell-really-shake-2016-race-n675606': ['nbccom', 'Will the Comey Bombshell Really Shake up the 2016 Race?', 'Https, Media-Cldnry.S-Nbcnews.Com Image Upload Newscms Chuck-Todd-Circle-Byline-Template.Jpg, Chuck Todd, Media-Cldnry.S-Nbcnews.Com Image Upload Newscms Mark-Murray-Circle-Byline-Template.Jpg, Mark Murray, Media-Cldnry.S-Nbcnews.Com Image Upload Newscms Carrie-Dann-Circle-Byline-Template.Jpg, Carrie Dann, Chuck Todd Is Moderator Of, Mark Murray Is A Senior Political Editor At Nbc News., Carrie Dann Is A Political Editor For Nbc News.', datetime.datetime(2016, 10, 31, 12, 16, 2), 'First Read is a morning briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the day\\'s most important political stories and why they matter.\\nAfter bombshell, does the remarkably stable ‘16 race stay stable?\\nThere’s no hyperbole in stating that the 2016 Hillary Clinton-vs.-Donald Trump presidential race has been the craziest we’ve covered. Consider all of the jaw-dropping moments: Mexican rapists. WikiLeaks. Vladimir Putin. The Access Hollywood video. Alicia Machado. Trump\\'s visit to Mexico. “Basket of Deplorables.” Birtherism. And the debates -- all of them. Despite them all, however, the race has been remarkably stable. Just look at the national NBC/WSJ poll numbers since Sept. 2015.\\nBut does that stability change after FBI Director James Comey’s bombshell Friday that his organization learned of the existence of new emails that appear “pertinent” to its previous investigation into Clinton’s email practices? One the one hand, the polling we’ve seen -- so far -- suggests that voters remain in their partisan corners. According to this weekend’s Washington Post/ABC poll, 63% of voters said the FBI’s review makes no difference. And among the 34% who say it makes them “less likely” to back Clinton, those voters are disproportionately Republicans and GOP-leaning independents. What’s more, the post-Comey polls we’ve seen (here and here) haven’t really budged, at least not yet. On the other hand, it has never been a positive for Clinton throughout this entire presidential race when the focus has been on her, especially on the subject of emails. Eight days to go…\\nThe latest developments in the Comey Surprise\\nMeanwhile, here are all of the latest developments in the Comey Surprise: The FBI obtained a warrant to search emails related to the probe of Hillary Clinton\\'s private server that were discovered on ex-congressman Anthony Weiner\\'s laptop... Also on Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid accused Comey of violating the Hatch Act, which bars government officials from using their authority to influence elections... Former Attorney General Eric Holder wrote a “scathing op-ed condemning FBI Director James Comey for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton\\'s use of a private email server. ‘I fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI’”… And NBC’s Ari Melber has a piece concluding that newly discovered emails -- even if they contain classified information -- would unlikely change the earlier conclusion not to charge Clinton.\\nFBI’s review of the emails could be quick\\nAdditionally, NBC\\'s Pete Williams reports that it\\'s possible the FBI\\'s review of the emails could end quickly -- now that the FBI obtained a warrant to search them. \"They\\'ll narrow them down to look at just those dating from the time Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. Then they\\'ll weed out any that are not about government business. Agents will use automated software to search what\\'s left for duplicates they\\'ve already found during the investigation of the Clinton e-mail server. Any that remain will be checked for classified information,” Williams reported on “Today” this morning. “Officials say there\\'s no way to tell how long that will take. But they say if it goes quickly, and nothing classified is found, the FBI could say so within the next few days. It largely depends on how many of the e-mails are duplicates and how many are new to the investigators.”\\nNBC/WSJ/Marist polls: Clinton up in NC, deadlocked race in FL\\nOver the weekend, we released brand-new NBC/WSJ/Marist polls of Florida and North Carolina (which were conducted before Friday’s bombshell news). The numbers:\\nIn Florida, Clinton gets the support of 45% of likely voters, while Trump gets 44%. Libertarian Gary Johnson gets 5% and the Green Party\\'s Jill Stein is at 2%. In an earlier NBC/WSJ/Marist poll this month, Clinton was ahead by three points in the four-person race in the Sunshine State, 45%-42%. When the contest is reduced to two candidates, Clinton and Trump are tied in the new poll at 46%.\\nIn North Carolina, meanwhile, Clinton enjoys a six-point lead over Trump among likely voters, 47%-41%, with Johnson at 8%. (Stein isn\\'t on the ballot in the Tar Heel State.) Earlier this month in the poll, Clinton was ahead by four points, 45%-41%. In a two-person race in North Carolina, Clinton\\'s lead in this new poll is an equal six points, 50%-44%.\\nThe polls (conducted Oct. 25-26) also measure early voting in these two states. Among the 36% of likely voters in Florida who say they\\'ve already voted, Clinton is ahead, 54% -37%. Among those who haven\\'t voted in the Sunshine State, Trump is up, 51%-42%. And Clinton leads by a 61%-33% margin among the 29% of North Carolinians who say they\\'ve already voted.\\nExamining Trump’s charitable giving -- or lack thereof\\nIt’s amazing when news about Donald Trump -- no matter how controversial -- gets drowned out by other events. Still, don’t miss this Washington Post piece into Trump’s charitable giving, or lack thereof: “For as long as he has been rich and famous, Donald Trump has also wanted people to believe he is generous. He spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public — even nationally televised — promises to give his own money away. It was, in large part, a facade. A months-long investigation by The Washington Post has not been able to verify many of Trump’s boasts about his philanthropy. Instead, throughout his life in the spotlight, whether as a businessman, television star or presidential candidate, The Post found that Trump had sought credit for charity he had not given — or had claimed other people’s giving as his own.”\\nHow violence and retaliation are constant themes in Trump’s rhetoric\\nAlso, do read NBC’s Benjy Sarlin on how violence and retaliation are common themes in Trump’s rhetoric and in his events. “In his eyes, the world is an unforgiving place where cities are ‘war zones,’ where ‘rapists’ are streaming across the border and where jealous rivals are hatching plots to humiliate America and Trump personally. To prevail in such an environment, he suggests, the response to any slight must be swift and overwhelming. Dwelling on limits imposed by law or tradition is usually a secondary concern. This framework has expressed itself in policy, in which Trump has extolled the use of torture, threatened reprisals against the families of terrorists and pledged to jail Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state. It has expressed itself rhetorically in vicious insults against critics and in his encouragement of violence by supporters.”\\nFirst Read’s downballot race of the day: Florida Senate\\nMarco Rubio rode to Republicans’ rescue when he reversed his pledge not to seek re-election, although it’s not a complete slam dunk that he’ll hold onto his seat. The former presidential candidate faces challenges -- most notably his well-known national ambitions and his frustration with the Senate, as well as his tortured relationship with the GOP presidential nominee. But luckily for Rubio, his Democratic opponent, Rep. Patrick Murphy, is far from an ideal candidate. He’s taken heat for overselling parts of his resume and for his reliance on his wealthy family for campaign donations. Our NBC/WSJ/Marist poll has it Rubio 51%, Murphy 43%.\\nOn the trail\\nHillary Clinton spends her day in Ohio, campaigning in Kent (in the Cleveland-Akron area) at 2:45 pm ET and then in Cincinnati at 6:15 pm ET… Donald Trump is in Michigan, hitting Grand Rapids at noon ET and Warren at 3:00 pm ET… Tim Kaine stumps in North Carolina… And Mike Pence is in Florida.\\nCountdown to Election Day: 8 days'], 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/dangerous-abuse-lawless-bipartisan-attack-trump-national-emergency-declaration-n971826': ['nbccom', \"'Dangerous.'

Celebrities, environmentalists, and political leaders blame Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, for destroying the world’s largest rainforest, the Amazon, which they say is the “lungs of the world.”\\nSingers and actors including Madonna and Jaden Smith shared photos on social media that were seen by tens of millions of people. “The lungs of the Earth are in flames,” said actor Leonardo DiCaprio. “The Amazon Rainforest produces more than 20% of the world’s oxygen,” tweeted soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo. “The Amazon rain forest — the lungs which produce 20% of our planet’s oxygen — is on fire,” tweeted French President Emanuel Macron.\\nAnd yet the photos weren’t actually of the fires and many weren’t even of the Amazon. The photo Ronaldo shared was taken in southern Brazil, far from the Amazon, in 2013. The photo that DiCaprio and Macron shared is over 20 years old. The photo Madonna and Smith shared is over 30. Some celebrities shared photos from Montana, India, and Sweden.\\nTo their credit, CNN and New York Times debunked the photos and other misinformation about the fires. “Deforestation is neither new nor limited to one nation,” explained CNN. “These fires were not caused by climate change,” noted The Times.\\nBut both publications repeated the claim that the Amazon is the “lungs” of the world. “The Amazon remains a net source of oxygen today,” said CNN. “The Amazon is often referred to as Earth’s ‘lungs,’ because its vast forests release oxygen and store carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping gas that is a major cause of global warming,” claimed The New York Times.\\nI was curious to hear what one of the world’s leading Amazon forest experts, Dan Nepstad, had to say about the “lungs” claim.\\n“It’s bullshit,” he said. “There’s no science behind that. The Amazon produces a lot of oxygen but it uses the same amount of oxygen through respiration so it’s a wash.”\\nPlants use respiration to convert nutrients from the soil into energy. They use photosynthesis to convert light into chemical energy, which can later be used in respiration.\\nWhat about The New York Times claim that “If enough rain forest is lost and can’t be restored, the area will become savanna, which doesn’t store as much carbon, meaning a reduction in the planet’s ‘lung capacity’”?\\nAlso not true, said Nepstad, who was a lead author of the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. “The Amazon produces a lot of oxygen, but so do soy farms and [cattle] pastures.”\\nSome people will no doubt wave away the “lungs” myth as nit-picking. The broader point is that there is an increase in fires in Brazil and something should be done about it.\\nBut the “lungs” myth is just the tip of the iceberg. Consider that CNN ran a long segment with the banner, “Fires Burning at Record Rate in Amazon Forest” while a leading climate reporter claimed, “The current fires are without precedent in the past 20,000 years.”\\nWhile the number of fires in 2019 is indeed 80% higher than in 2018, it’s just 7% higher than the average over the last 10 years ago, Nepstad said.\\nINPE\\nOne of Brazil’s leading environmental journalists agrees that media coverage of the fires has been misleading. “It was under [Workers Party President] Lula and [Environment Secretary] Marina Silva (2003-2008) that Brazil had the highest incidence of burning,” Leonardo Coutinho told me over email. “But neither Lula nor Marina was accused of putting the Amazon at risk.”\\nCoutinho’s perspective was shaped by reporting on the ground in the Amazon for Veja, Brazil’s leading news magazine, for nearly a decade. By contrast, many of the correspondents reporting on the fires have been doing so from the cosmopolitan cities of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, which are 2,500 miles and four hours by jet plane away.\\n“What is happening in the Amazon is not exceptional,” said Coutinho. “Take a look at Google web searches search for ‘Amazon’ and ‘Amazon Forest’ over time. Global public opinion was not as interested in the ‘Amazon tragedy’ when the situation was undeniably worse. The present moment does not justify global hysteria.”\\nAnd while fires in Brazil have increased, there is no evidence that Amazon forest fires have.\\n“What hurts me most is the bare idea of the millions of Notre-Dames, high cathedrals of terrestrial biodiversity, burning to the ground,” a Brazilian journalist wrote in the New York Times.\\nBut the Amazon forest’s high cathedrals aren’t doing that. “I saw the photo Macron and Di Caprio tweeted,” said Nepstad, “but you don’t see forests burning like that in the Amazon.”\\nAmazon forest fires are hidden by the tree canopy and only increase during drought years. “We don’t know if there are any more forest fires this year than in past years, which tells me there probably isn’t,” Nepstad said. “I’ve been working on studying those fires for 25 years and our [on-the-ground] networks are tracking this.”\\nWhat increased by 7% in 2019 are the fires of dry scrub and trees cut down for cattle ranching as a strategy to gain ownership of land.\\nAgainst the picture painted of an Amazon forest on the verge of disappearing, a full 80% remains standing. Half of the Amazon is protected against deforestation under federal law.\\n“Few stories in the first wave of media coverage mentioned the dramatic drop in deforestation in Brazil in the 2000s,” noted former New York Times reporter Andrew Revkin, who wrote a 1990 book, The Burning Season, about the Amazon, and is now Founding Director, Initiative on Communication & Sustainability at The Earth Institute at Columbia University.\\nDeforestation declined a whopping 70% from 2004 to 2012. It has risen modestly since then but remains at one-quarter its 2004 peak. And just 3% of the Amazon is suitable for soy farming.\\nBoth Nepstad and Coutinho say the real threat is from accidental forest fires in drought years, which climate change could worsen. “The most serious threat to the Amazon forest is the severe events that make the forests vulnerable to fire. That’s where we can get a downward spiral between fire and drought and more fire.”\\nToday, 18 - 20% of the Amazon forest remains at risk of being deforested.\\n“I don’t like the international narrative right now because it’s polarizing and divisive,” said Nepstad. “Bolsonaro has said some ridiculous things and none of them are excusable but there’s also a big consensus against accidental fire and we have to tap into that.”\\n“Imagine you are told [under the federal Forest Code] that you can only use half of your land and then being told you can only use 20%,” Nepstad said. “There was a bait and switch and the farmers are really frustrated. These are people who love to hunt and fish and be on land and should be allies but we lost them.”\\nNepstad said that the restrictions cost farmers $10 billion in foregone profits and forest restoration. “There was an Amazon Fund set up in 2010 with $1 billion from Norwegian and German governments but none of it ever made its way to the large and medium-sized farmers,” says Nepstad.\\nBoth the international pressure and the government’s over-reaction is increasing resentment among the very people in Brazil environmentalists need to win over in order to save the Amazon: forests and ranchers.\\n“Macron’s tweet had the same impact on Bolsonaro’s base as Hillary calling Trump’s base deplorable,” said Nepstad. “There’s outrage at Macron in Brazil. The Brazilians want to know why California gets all this sympathy for its forest fires and while Brazil gets all this finger-pointing.”\\n“I don’t mind the media frenzy as long as it leaves something positive,” said Nepstad, but it has instead forced the Brazilian government to over-react. “Sending in the army is not the way to go because it’s not all illegal actors. People forget that there are legitimate reasons for small farmers to use controlled burns to knock back insects and pests.”\\nThe reaction from foreign media, global celebrities, and NGOs in Brazil stems from a romantic anti-capitalism common among urban elites, say Nepstad and Coutinho. “There’s a lot of hatred of agribusiness,” said Nepstad. “I’ve had colleagues say, ‘Soy beans aren’t food.’ I said, ‘What does your kid eat? Milk, chicken, eggs? That’s all soy protein fed to poultry.’”\\nOthers may have political motives. “Brazilian farmers want to extend [the free trade agreement] EU-Mercosur but Macron is inclined to shut it down because the French farm sector doesn’t want more Brazilian food products coming into the country,” Nepstad explained.\\nDespite climate change, deforestation, and widespread and misleading coverage of the situation, Nepstad hasn’t given up hope. The Amazon emergency should lead the conservation community to repair its relationship with farmers and seek more pragmatic solutions, he said.\\n“Agribusiness is 25% of Brazil’s GDP and it’s what got the country through the recession,” said Nepstad. “When soy farming comes into a landscape, the number of fires goes down. Little towns get money for schools, GDP rises, and inequality declines. This is not a sector to beat up on, it’s one to find common ground with.”\\nNepstad argued that it would be a no-brainer for governments around the world to support Aliança da Terra, a fire detection and prevention network he co-founded which is comprised of 600 volunteers, mostly indigenous people, and farmers.\\n“For $2 million a year we could control the fires and stop the Amazon die-back,” said Nepstad. “We have 600 people who have received top-notch training by US fire jumpers but now need trucks with the right gear so they can clear fire breaks through the forest and start a backfire to burn up the fuel in the pathway of the fire.”\\nFor such pragmatism to take hold among divergent interests, the news media will need to improve its future coverage of the issue.\\n“One of the grand challenges facing newsrooms covering complicated emergent, enduring issues like tropical deforestation,” said journalist Revkin, “is finding ways to engage readers without histrionics. The alternative is ever more whiplash journalism — which is the recipe for reader disengagement.”\\nRead more on this topic at Forbes:'], 'https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shutdown/pelosi-no-wall-money-in-u-s-border-deal-talks-idUSKCN1PP28J': ['reuters.com', 'Trump, Democrats battle in early stage of U.S. border security talks', 'Amanda Becker, Richard Cowan', datetime.datetime(2019, 1, 31, 16, 25, 44), 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats hardened their positions on Thursday over a wall being built on the border with Mexico, raising new doubts over their ability to reach a deal just as negotiations were getting under way.\\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters: “There’s not going to be any wall money in the legislation” to fund border security for the rest of this year.\\nInstead, Pelosi said funding for more ports of entry or additional border security technology was open for negotiation.

Spitzer, Nan Aron, Days Ago, Pm Et, Hours Ago', datetime.datetime(2020, 2, 18, 16, 0, 10), 'In the story by Franz Kafka, “In the Penal Colony,” an officer was standing next to a lethal punishing machine. When asked about his qualifications, he explained simply, “My guiding principle is this: Guilt is never to be doubted.” It seems many in Washington can claim the same Kafkaesque qualification this week when it comes to Attorney General William Barr.\\nAfter a Justice Department sentencing recommendation was withdrawn and replaced in the case of Roger Stone, Senator Elizabeth Warren said, “If that guy will not resign, then the House should start impeachment proceedings against him.” Not to be outdone, Representative Maxine Waters declared, “Bill Barr should not only be disbarred, but he, Donald Trump, and Roger Stone should be sharing a jail cell.”\\nWhat is most astonishing about the calls for impeachment, incarceration, and disbarment is that they ignore any countervailing information other than raw political manipulation of the Justice Department. Even more importantly, they ignore even the slightest possibility that the Justice Department may have done the right thing for the right reason.\\nMore than 1,100 former Justice Department officials are calling on Barr to resign due to allegations of political interference. Notably, in expressing alarm over the threat to professional ethics, these lawyers did not feel it was necessary to learn critical details about the underlying controversy before warning of “future abuses” and “unlawful orders.” They show the same lack of interest in a fair process they accuse Barr of committing.\\nI have been a friend of Barr for years, and I also testified in favor of his confirmation before the Senate. Nevertheless, when this controversy erupted, I immediately stated that these concerns were legitimate and that an investigation is warranted. I still believe that. However, the calls for summary judgment ignore three key elements in reaching any conclusion, which are the timing, the merits, and the process.\\nThe calls for impeachment and incarceration began as most scandals do in the Trump administration with irresponsible tweets from the president. It was not surprising or unreasonable for critics to latch on to the timing of the tweets followed by the withdrawal of the sentencing recommendation and resignations of prosecutors in the Stone case.\\nHowever, both the White House and the Justice Department quickly stated that there was no communication between Trump and Barr regarding the case and that the decision to withdraw the recommendation was made previously. If true, Trump showed his uncanny ability to undermine his own administration and then magnified that damage with a type of “atta boy” for Barr after the recommendation was withdrawn.\\nBarr then gave a television interview criticizing tweets by the president about pending federal criminal cases as “making it impossible to do my job.” Critics seemed caught off guard for about five minutes, and then resumed their calls for his utter destruction. The interview did not fit their narrative of Barr being a witless Trump troll so it was ignored.\\n(Just for the record, also ignored in the coverage is how the Justice Department under Barr allowed the Russia investigations to proceed unimpeded despite continual tweets by the president, prosecuted and convicted various Trump associates, including Stone, over objections by the president, declined to charge either James Comey or Andrew McCabe despite demands by the president, continued to investigate Trump figures and related businesses, and has not only prosecuted but expanded the investigation of close associates of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani.)\\nWorse yet, many media analysts and legal experts ignored one relevant point, which is that Barr was correct. Justice Department prosecutors were wildly off base in their initial draconian recommendation of seven to nine years in prison for Stone. It was on the high end of the sentencing guidelines range, but only because prosecutors “stacked” counts against Stone, who is generally viewed as a clownish political provocateur. This time, what he has called his “performance art” went too far.\\nBefore this controversy erupted, many of us, including critics of the Trump administration, described the sentencing recommendation as excessive. The new recommendation got it correct. It recommended that Stone be given prison time but not a maximum sentence. That is precisely what the court should do. In other words, the prosecutors got it wrong and the new recommendation did precisely what the Justice Department is supposed to do in advising a court honestly and fairly.\\nThere are good faith reasons to question a Justice Department process that led to the resignation of multiple prosecutors after the lowering of a recommended sentence for a friend of the president. There also stands a legitimate question of why it was necessary to intervene in this particular case over a sentencing recommendation. However, there are reasons to be skeptical of the portrayals of a Justice Department commissariat slavishly carrying out orders by the president.\\nFirst and foremost, there is indeed nothing uncommon about the Justice Department criminal division supervising or even dictating the moves within a high profile federal case. You see, Main Justice has prosecutors too. The United States Attorney manual states, “If primary prosecutorial responsibility for a matter has been assumed by the criminal division or higher authority, the United States Attorney shall consult with the persons having primary responsibility before conducting grand jury proceedings, seeking indictment, or filing an information.”\\nIt is not unprecedented for Main Justice to overrule local prosecutors. For example, in 2008 when President Obama was first running for the White House, prosecutors wanted to bring charges against Black Panthers who stood in front of polling places brandishing weapons. Attorney General Eric Holder and the Justice Department overruled them, despite a rather widespread view that the men were trying to intimidate voters. There were no calls to impeach or incarcerate Holder, who was widely viewed as one of the most political attorney generals in modern history.\\nBarr has explained that there was a “miscommunication” after a meeting at Main Justice where he believed it was understood that “we should not affirmatively recommend seven to nine years.” Instead, the prosecutors recommended that extreme sentence. According to some accounts, they made it over the objection of interim United States Attorney Tim Shea, a veteran prosecutor, who told Main Justice that he and other prosecutors considered the sentencing recommendation to be too harsh.\\nNone of this means that there was no political interference or that there should not be an investigation. There are serious credible concerns to be investigated, and Barr has agreed to appear before Congress to answer those questions. However, the critics have shown the very same disregard for the facts, the merits, and the process that they ascribe to Barr.\\nI have my own presumptions and bias regarding Barr, based on decades of friendship. Yet neither affinity nor hostility should shape our analysis of this episode. So here is a novel suggestion. Before we impeach, disbar, and incarcerate Barr, maybe we should hear from him.\\nJonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law for George Washington University and served as the last lead counsel during a Senate impeachment trial.

Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.”\\nAt a separate event with campaign donors at New York City’s Cipriani restaurant on Thursday, Trump waved a copy of the rough transcript of his call with Zelensky and boasted that it was good news for the GOP because it had prompted a flood of donations.\\n“This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to the Republican Party,” Trump said, according to an attendee.\\nWhen the crowd chanted “four more years,” the president responded by joking that they shouldn’t stop there.\\n“If you really want their heads to explode, you should chant eight more years,” Trump said.\\n— Josh Dawsey\\n2:30 p.m.: Timeline: The alarming pattern of actions by Trump included in whistleblower allegations\\nSix weeks after it was submitted, a complaint from an intelligence community whistleblower has been declassified and released publicly.

James Zirin, in his superb book, Plaintiff in Chief, chronicles the 3,500 lawsuits to which Trump has been a party, a pattern of scorched-earth attacks that include deliberate “delay, counterattack, obstruction, deflection, confusion, threats of ruin, and blanket assertion of attorney/client privilege to avoid accountability.” These were tricks he learned from the notorious Roy Cohn, and they were largely successful in helping him evade legal accountability throughout his business career.\\nAdvertisement\\nThey were, it turns out, the same tricks Trump brought to the campaign trail and later to the White House. It was all, writes Zirin, a dangerous new approach for a president:\\nTrump is very different. His instinctive litigiousness; his abuse of the legal process to obtain leverage, not justice; his mean-spirited statements and conduct; his overblown damage claims; his many lies, exaggerations and prevarications; his willingness to sue, trash, or discard even those who did him a good turn along the way are abnormal by any standard.\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nDonald Trump staked his career on the bet that if you’re rich, famous, brazen, and unrepentant, the law will let you do it. He staked his presidency on the same.\\nIt is a paradox that the most litigious country in the world—a country whose founding documents were largely drafted by lawyers, and whose constitutional true north has long been the constraints afforded by the law—elected a man who has spent the bulk of his life creating a two-tiered system, in which some men are bound by law and others float away from it. We knew long before he was elected that Donald Trump would not be bound by the rule of law, or by the norms of a system dependent on checks and balances. He told us as much. During the campaign he floated the prospect of torturing the families of enemies, and rewriting libel laws, and banning travelers to the United States based on their religion. Sure, it maybe sounded like hyperbole, and it maybe sounded like campaign-speak, and even as some of those efforts were effectuated, including the Muslim ban and family separations, and even as the norms about nepotism and self-dealing and disclosure were brushed away, it still seemed as if a country founded on law would locate some guardrails.\\nAdvertisement\\nIt hasn’t. Just as Zirin promised us, Trump has deployed all of his Roy Cohn strategies to show us that the law is for suckers, and that for great men it serves as a nuisance at most, something to be gotten out of with a squadron of well-paid lawyers, by terrorizing opposing parties and witnesses, by lying fluently and repeatedly, and by declaring victory even when you lost. It should not surprise a soul that he would have brought those tactics to bear as a candidate, as president, and as the subject of an impeachment inquiry. The legal arguments he has deployed throughout this process—that he should have “absolute immunity” from investigation; that he could not be removed from office for crimes; and that he could only be impeached for literal crimes, not high crimes and misdemeanors as the Framers intended—were vintage Roy Cohn. As was the argument, as proffered by Alan Dershowitz, that if the president believed his election interference was in the best interest of the republic, it was both not illegal and also not an impeachable offense. The fact that the Senate and the Justice Department helped him evade accountability, or that White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Dershowitz and Ken Starr served as Roy Cohn mini-me’s, should surprise nobody. Nor should the fact that the “trial” was not a trial and the jurors were not jurors or that a nontrivial number of the jurors voted to acquit him while still acknowledging that what he did was the thing he continues to deny having done.\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nNobody should be surprised that in the wake of 3,500 lawsuits, Trump will conclude that he is indeed above the law, that the legal regime exists only for suckers, and also that he can repurpose the machinery of law to investigate, harass, and punish the whistleblowers and the witnesses and those who sought to constrain him. At which point the law won’t just be the thing that applies only to losers and suckers, but also the thing that can be used to put down those who sought justice in the first place. And nobody should be surprised that having invited foreign election interference and having been acquitted for doing so, this president will use the formidable power of his Justice Department to manipulate the 2020 election, and to call into question the results of that election in the courts.\\nAdvertisement\\nWe can debate the wisdom of Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi and the ticktock of the impeachment investigation and trial—whether it should have been broader, or gone longer, or relied upon court rulings that never came. But we can hopefully agree that what they attempted to do was use both legal processes and legal arguments to show that when a president abuses the power of his office and denies accountability, it should matter. They were trying to prove that the law isn’t just there to punish asylum-seekers trapped in Mexico or black men in prisons, but that it should apply to everyone, even the wealthy, and even the people who believe it doesn’t apply to them because it never has in the past. Donald Trump staked a decadeslong business career on the bet that if you’re rich, famous, brazen, and unrepentant, the law will let you do it. He staked his presidency on the same. Republicans who deplore the death of “unity” today should remember that this was once a nation unified around at least the hope that the law was for everyone, and that going forward, it will be divided around the certainty that some people don’t answer to the courts or the Constitution.

But I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that.”\\nIn this case, the court found in favor of a movie theater that was allegedly showing an obscene film. The “I know it when I see it” definition is obviously problematic in myriad ways, not least of which is that a person crossing the line into porn, or any other restricted activity, has no real basis to know where that line is.\\nAs Stewart points out, some questions, like what is porn, defy simple categories and definitions, so instead must be judged on a subjective societal scale. Potter isn’t simply saying that he can’t intelligibly define porn; he’s saying the court and the state can’t. Frankly, neither can society at large.\\nSomething very similar is occurring with the concept of racism in our discourse. While once we had, or thought we had, some fairly firm definitions for racist activity or speech, most having to do with intent or belief, we now have an “I know it when I see it” standard. The same problems underlie this standard in regard to racism: nobody can really know when he is guilty of it.\\nDonald Trump tweeting that the leftist non-white women in the House of Representatives loosely known as “The Squad” should go back to the countries they came from and fix the problems there, then come back and show us how they did it, is a prime example of how different Americans define racism differently.\\nOf the congresswomen Trump was presumably talking about, only Rep. Ilhan Omar was born in another country, Somalia, which has a government that makes “Lord of the Flies” look like a democratic utopia. In regard to the others, I think Trump deserves some criticism for not understanding they are just as American (as is Omar) as he is.\\nBut let’s not kid ourselves. Rep. Rashida Tlaib identifies as a Palestinian-American and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez identifies as a Latina-American. When Trump suggests they go to the places they identify with and pull the planks from their eyes there, he’s not just making stuff up. He’s making an entirely reasonable point that America is pretty awesome in comparison to a lot of places. Presumably this is why so many people want to be here.\\nBut let’s think about what the “I know it when I see it” standard did for pornography in the United States. This “I don’t know, maybe it is, maybe it isn’t, maybe even it is it’s fine” attitude, along with the Internet, has made pornography a staple of American society. It is ubiquitous and unstoppable. Don’t we see the same thing occurring with accusations of racism, and maybe even the fostering of racist beliefs?\\nAs I have long warned, many white Americans have become so fed up with notion of their unintentional racism, and their duty to pay reparations for the sins of their fathers and mothers, that they have turned a blind eye to the racism that does actually exist. But are they really to blame for this?\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden have both recently been accused of racism, or engaging in racist tropes, or whatever we’re calling it now. The attacks are nonsensical and absurd. Ultimately, so too are the attacks on Trump. Racism has become the new pornography. We know it when we see it, maybe. Or maybe we are wrong. Maybe saying “Whiteness is bad” is perfectly fine and everything is about the color of our skin.\\nI hope this isn’t the case. But I worry my hope is a rusted penny dropped in a fountain that can grant no wishes. My better and sensible mind knows that, just like pornography, racism will flourish under a “I know it when I see it” philosophy and an Internet that is not shy about flaunting its views.

The network\\'s lawyers argued that the administration’s decision to kick him out violated the First Amendment and his due process rights, and that the White House had offered no notice or opportunity to fight the decision.\\n“Our Constitution, well-established law, and the core principles of our democracy establish that the White House cannot be permitted to cast out and punish reporters with whom it disagrees,” CNN\\'s lawyers said in a written argument.\\nMuch of the debate focused on a 1977 case at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which CNN said prevented revoking credentials “based on arbitrary or less than compelling reasons.”\\nBut the Justice Department argued the case was narrower than CNN described and focused on a Secret Service denial of access.\\nAlso Thursday, the White House Correspondents Association filed an argument in the case warning that the court could set a “dangerous precedent.”\\n“The WHCA brief highlights the danger posed to all journalists, and to the American public, if the President’s claim is permitted to stand,” said Olivier Knox, the group’s president.\\nOther media organizations, including Gannett Co., the parent of USA TODAY, said this week that they planned to file briefs with the court supporting CNN.\\nIf Trump is allowed to deny access to any reporter he considers “bad” or “rude” or “fake news,” he would have “unbridled discretion to decide who can report from inside the White House,” according to the WHCA’s argument.\\n“The president’s view of the law is wrong,” the argument said. “While he may have absolute discretion to exclude a member of the press from his Trump Tower residence, he does not have absolute discretion to exclude a member of the press from the White House,” the seat of the executive branch and an iconic place for civil discourse.\\nMore: USA TODAY Network to file brief backing CNN lawsuit against White House over Acosta credentials'], 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54376618': ['bbc.com', 'President Trump has Covid-19: How global media responded', '', datetime.datetime(2020, 10, 2, 13, 37), 'Elsewhere, questions have been asked about what the news could actually mean for the US presidential election.

Not in these hundreds of communities.\\nBy Mark Gerzon, Contributor\\nJacquelyn Martin/AP People in the crowd hold up homemade signs at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear in Washington Saturday, Oct. 30, 2010. The \"sanity\" rally, blending laughs and political activism, drew thousands to the National Mall Saturday, with comedians Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert casting themselves as the unlikely maestros of moderation and civility in polarized times.\\nAfter enduring a toxic year-long mudslinging contest, it is all too easy to conclude that civility is dead.\\nIt certainly seems that America is divided. Not only have the two major parties pulled further apart, but our culture as a whole — media, business, universities, you name it — seems to be increasingly polarized.\\nTelevision networks such as Fox News and MSNBC are clearly politically aligned, and the Internet has given each of us the opportunity to surround ourselves with news that fits our opinion. Research confirms that corporate boards of directors are overwhelmingly “red” (by an almost 2-1 ratio). By contrast, university faculties are overwhelmingly blue (almost two-thirds identify as “far left” or “liberal”).\\nGiven this polarization, it is natural to feel disheartened and to fear that America is becoming completely politically segregated. But the good news is that hundreds of communities across the country are going in just the opposite direction. They are becoming vibrant places where citizens from across the political spectrum are working together to strengthen the civic fabric and revitalize democracy.\\n• • •\\nENGAGE: How schools can bring civility to politics\\nBy John Gable, Contributor\\nWith all the divisive rhetoric, sensationalist journalism, and inflamed passions during this election cycle, schools can be one of our saving graces.\\nBut only if teachers aren’t terrified about discussing elections.\\nTeachers recognize the need to discuss politics in order to prepare their students for their adult lives. But how can you do that without creating divisions within your classroom or introducing your own biases? Any false step, real or imagined, could lead to repercussions in the class, from parents and the administration.\\nUnsurprisingly, 40 percent of teachers are hesitant to teach about the election. And with that reluctance, it is no wonder that some college students feel unprepared to vote in elections.\\nThat is why a friend and I, along with help from dozens of educators and mediation professionals ranging from the far left to the far right politically, launched AllSidesForSchools.org and its “Elections and Relationships” program and lesson plans.\\nHere is the basic idea.\\nGet stories that\\nempower and uplift daily.

Political professionals and parties have many shortcomings to answer for—including, primarily on the Republican side, their self-mutilating embrace of anti-establishment rhetoric—but relentlessly bashing them is no solution. You haven’t heard anyone say this, but it’s time someone did: Our most pressing political problem today is that the country abandoned the establishment, not the other way around.\\n2. \"Politics Isn\\'t Broken,\" US News and World Report\\nThe system isn\\'t broken. We are merely experiencing another period of public restlessness. Representative government means elected officials are tasked with representing – giving voice and acting on – their constituents\\' concerns. Hence, the problem is not who is serving as a representative, but who they\\'re representing. Said another way, Washington only seems broken because we, the people, don\\'t agree on either what ails us or how best to fix it. Further, about the only thing we do agree on is that Washington is not to be trusted.\\n3. \"Why are so many Republicans and Democrats pretending to be independents?\" The Washington Post\\nPeople \\'go undercover\\' — or hide their partisanship behind the label \\'independent\\' — because they are too embarrassed to admit their partisanship. Being embarrassed to admit your partisanship leads you to avoid behaviors that are overtly partisan. This is a big problem for democratic politics, since overtly partisan behaviors are often the behaviors that have the most political \\'voice.\\'\\n4. \"American politics needs more civility, not less,\" The Boston Globe\\nWe have reached a point where politicians fear to commit themselves to even the mildest standard of civility. In 2009, two prominent political activists, Republican Mark DeMoss and Democrat Lanny Davis, launched a campaign to try and soften the nation’s harsh public tone. They wrote to all 535 members of Congress and the 50 governors, asking each to sign a simple Civility Pledge: \\'I will be civil in my public discourse and behavior. I will be respectful of others whether or not I agree with them. I will stand against incivility when I see it.\\' For months the bipartisan duo promoted their civility campaign. But in the end, of the 585 elected officials to whom they sent the pledge, only three — three — were willing to sign.\\n5. \"Sen. Susan Collins upon receiving Javitz Prize for Bipartisanship\"\\nEven in this highly charged political environment, it is still possible to find members in both parties who understand that compromise is not a dirty word, that it does not mean betraying one’s principles. Rather, compromise is a means of accomplishment, of understanding and respecting and honoring differences of opinion in order to achieve real solutions… Unyielding adherence to an extreme position is easy. It is compromise, good faith, and the hard work of bringing people together that requires determination, intellect and courage.\\nAlso be sure to check out some of the Monitor\\'s in-depth coverage on partisanship and compromise in US politics.\\n1. \"Why swing voters are vanishing from US politics,\" by Peter Grier, Staff writer\\nHere’s a prediction about the 2016 presidential election that’s almost certain to come true: Generally speaking, swing voters won’t. Swing, that is. Float. Change their preference. Vote for the Republican if they voted for President Obama in 2012. Vote for the Democrat if they pulled the lever for Mitt Romney last time out. That’s because the United States is becoming a country where no one changes his or her mind about presidential politics. Voters are increasingly divided into reliably partisan camps. Those swing voters pundits love to talk about? They’re mythical creatures, unicorns, nothing but a flash of white in the forest at dusk. New research shows they’re now about 5 percent of the US electorate – the lowest percentage ever recorded.\\n2. \"Susan Collins, a Republican armed for compromise,\" by Francine Kiefer, Staff writer\\nEvery senator knew that the four gun-control measures brought up post-Orlando were going down in a partisan duel on the Senate floor on Monday.

At a minimum, somebody’s got to be fired,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said.\\n“There’s got to be a change in the culture, also,” Horowitz replied, seemingly agreeing with Kennedy’s assessment.\\nCommittee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) cautioned lawmakers and observers against interpreting the FBI’s handling of the probe as an otherwise solid investigation with “a few irregularities,” suggesting the bureau’s actions threatened to undermine the entire system.\\nThe FBI got a reprieve from many Democratic lawmakers who expressed admiration for its work and sought to underscore Horowitz’s finding that the bureau was not influenced by political bias in launching its investigation.\\nBut the fallout for the FBI could linger, particularly given President Trump’s rocky relationship with the bureau.\\nHearing provides fodder for Trump, allies\\nHorowitz’s criticism of the FBI offered plenty of talking points for Trump and his defenders, some of whom have distorted the conclusions of the report to baselessly accuse agents of a politically motivated effort to investigate the Trump campaign.\\nThe inspector general turned up evidence that an FBI lawyer altered a document in connection with a renewal application for the Page warrant, a detail that Trump and Republicans have seized on.\\nHorowitz reiterated that he found no testimonial or documentary evidence of political bias or other improper motivation driving the FBI’s decision to open the counterintelligence investigation — dubbed “Crossfire Hurricane” — into the Trump campaign and Russia.\\nHorowitz also said that it was his conclusion that the investigation was adequately predicated. Those findings and other details of the report have undercut arguments made by Trump and his allies about the impropriety of the investigation.\\nBut at the same time, Horowitz said that the explanations his office received from officials about the errors and omissions were not “satisfactory” and was careful about making a definitive statement about a lack of bias in the attorney’s actions with respect to the warrant.\\nRepublicans argued that the mistakes made during the course of the investigation were deliberate and malicious.\\n“It may have started lawfully. It got off the rails quick,” Graham said. “It became a criminal conspiracy to defraud the FISA court, to put Mr. Page through hell, and to continue to surveil President Trump after he got elected. And I hope somebody pays a price for that.”\\nRare agreement for reform of the process\\nRepublicans and Democrats appeared in agreement on one thing following Wednesday’s hearing: the need for changes to the FISA program to avoid the missteps Horowitz identified in his report.\\n“If the [FISA] court doesn’t take corrective action and do something about being manipulated and lied to, you will lose my support,” Graham said, adding that he would like to see more “checks and balances.”\\nA few Republicans directly apologized to Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), telling the national security hawk that they had not believed the FISA process could be so seriously abused and indicating an openness to changes.\\nSen. Christopher Coons (D-Del.) also asked Horowitz about potential changes to the FISA program that could prevent future breakdowns in the application process, calling it “one of the only points” with bipartisan agreement.\\n“I’d welcome suggestions from FBI Director [Christopher] Wray … to ensure the errors we saw here in the Page process don’t happen again,” Coons said, adding there should be considerations for civil liberties as well.\\nHorowitz said the inspector general’s office does not make legislative recommendations to Congress, but instead would relay its suggestions within the Justice Department about how the FISA process could be improved.\\nHorowitz resists political fight\\nThe watchdog chose his words carefully throughout Wednesday’s appearance.\\nHe tiptoed around some of the more politically charged questions from members, seeking to avoid wading into debates about whether the president’s campaign was “spied” on and declining to speculate on matters beyond his report.\\nHorowitz declined to use the word “spying” despite its frequent use by Trump and Attorney General William Barr to describe FBI activities. Asked if it would be spying were the FISA warrants for Page unlawful, Horowitz hesitated before calling it “illegal” or “unlawful” surveillance.\\nUnder questioning from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Horowitz declined to say specifically that his findings refuted allegations about a “deep state conspiracy” against Trump and his campaign, saying simply that the inquiry found “no bias” in the opening of the investigation.\\nHorowitz also declined to weigh in on Barr’s disagreement with his findings after the attorney general issued a statement Monday saying the investigation had been launched on the “thinnest” of suspicions.\\n“He’s free to have his opinion. We have our finding,” Horowitz said.\\nHis effort to avoid political statements did not come as a surprise; Horowitz, a former assistant U.S. attorney, has been described as an independent voice and a straight shooter who seeks to stay away from politics.\\nSpotlight on internal Justice Department disagreements\\nHorowitz’s testimony offered new details about the daylight between him and some top Justice Department officials over his finding that the investigation was adequately predicated.\\nHorowitz said he was “surprised” by the decision by John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut leading a separate Russia inquiry, to issue a statement Monday disagreeing with his finding as to the opening of the FBI’s investigation.\\nHe also said he met with Durham in November to discuss his findings, at which point Durham told Horowitz he believed the FBI would have been justified in opening a “preliminary investigation,” but not a full one.\\n“He said that he did not necessarily agree with our conclusion about the opening of a full counterintelligence investigation, which is what this was,” Horowitz recalled.\\n“But … [Durham] said during the meeting that the information from the friendly foreign government was, in his view, sufficient to support the preliminary investigation,” he continued, referring to information received about comments made former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos.\\nHorowitz also said he communicated with Barr, who also disagreed with the conclusion as to the predicate, before the report’s release.\\n“None of the discussions changed our findings here,” Horowitz said.\\nBarr elaborated on his opinions during an NBC News interview Tuesday, calling the FBI’s case “flimsy” and saying the steps taken were not justified by the evidence.'], 'https://apnews.com/f2d8d48dede72f5ceb9883e97818caa2': ['apcom', 'Watchdog caught in political crossfire on his Russia report', 'Eric Tucker, Michael Balsamo', datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 20, 11, 6, 4), \"Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz testifies at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the Inspector General's report on alleged abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Wednesday, Dec. 11, 2019, on Capitol Hill in Washington.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department’s internal watchdog was caught in a political tug of war Wednesday as Republican and Democratic senators used his report on the origins of the Russia investigation involving Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign to support their views that it was a legitimate probe or a badly bungled farce.\\nInspector General Michael Horowitz testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee about his findings that while the FBI had a legitimate basis to launch the investigation and was not motivated by political bias in doing so, there were major flaws in how that investigation was conducted.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nThe hearing was the latest reflection of Washington’s intense politicization. Senators from both parties praised a detailed, nuanced report by a widely respected, nonpartisan investigator, while pressing him to call attention to findings that back their positions.\\nHorowitz himself tried to strike a balance.\\nHe noted, on one hand, his conclusion that there was a proper basis to open the investigation and that that decision did not appear motivated by political bias. And under questioning from Democrats, he acknowledged the absence of evidence for some of the most sensational claims by Trump and his supporters: that the investigation into ties between his presidential campaign and Russia had been opened for political reasons, that agents had infiltrated his election bid or that former President Barack Obama had directed a wiretap of the Republican candidate.\\nStill, his opening statement was overwhelmingly critical of the investigation, and he returned time and again throughout the hearing to serious problems that he said underscored the need for policy changes. He made clear that the FBI should not be comforted by his findings.\\nThe most serious problems, he said, concerned FBI applications for court approval to eavesdrop on a former Trump campaign aide. He rebuked officials up and down the chain of command for failing to update judges as they learned new information that undercut some of their original assertions.\\n“It doesn’t vindicate anybody at the FBI who touched this, including the leadership,” Horowitz said. That was a rejection of the views of former FBI Director James Comey, who earlier this week had claimed vindication for the bureau based on Horowitz’s conclusions.\\nRepublicans and Democrats pressed Horowitz on whether he believed the FBI had acted with partisan bias. His response was hedged: He said the multitude of errors during the surveillance warrant process, which included the altering of an email by an FBI lawyer, was so “inexplicable” and yielded no obvious explanations that he could not be confident about the intention.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nEven so, Horowitz also repeatedly noted under questioning from Democrats that he had not found evidence that the FBI opened its investigation for political reasons. The probe began with proper cause, he said, after the FBI learned that a Trump campaign aide had been told that Russia had information that could hurt the presidential campaign of Trump’s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.\\n“It finds that it was a properly predicated investigation based on the rules of the FBI,” Horowitz said of his report.\\nTrump and his supporters are counting on different conclusions from a separate investigation led by John Durham, a prosecutor selected by Attorney General William Barr to investigate the early days of the Russia investigation. Durham issued a statement disputing some of Horowitz’s conclusions.\\nBut Horowitz said they had a relatively technical disagreement — Durham, he said, believed the evidence was sufficient to open a preliminary investigation but not a full one. The latter gives the FBI more intrusive tools for an investigation.\\nHorowitz’s report identified significant problems with applications to receive and renew warrants to monitor the communications of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page in 2016 and 2017. Investigators were concerned about Page’s ties to Russia, but never accused him of wrongdoing.\\nHorowitz told senators that the FBI failed to follow its own standards for accuracy and completeness when it sought a warrant from the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to monitor Page’s communications.\\n“We are deeply concerned that so many basic and fundamental errors were made by three separate, handpicked investigative teams, on one of the most sensitive FBI investigations, after the matter had been briefed to the highest levels within the FBI,” Horowitz said.\\nAsked at one point if he believed that Page had been treated fairly, Horowitz responded that he didn’t believe the applications were handled fairly and that Page “was on the receiving end.”\\nThe report detailed 17 errors and omissions during those wiretap applications, including failing to tell the court when questions were raised about the reliability of some of the information that it had presented to receive the warrants.\\nThose problems were especially alarming because the warrant to monitor Page “related so closely to an ongoing presidential campaign” and “even though those involved with the investigation knew that their actions were likely to be subjected to close scrutiny.”\\nHorowitz’s findings that the FBI was justified in launching the investigation has been criticized by Barr, a vocal Trump defender. On Tuesday, Barr said the Russia investigation was based on a “bogus narrative. He declined to rule out that agents may have acted in bad faith.\\nHorowitz said he has spoken with Barr about his findings and that the attorney general did not present anything that changed his conclusions.\\nRepublican senators asked about another criticism Horowitz leveled at the FBI — that the bureau sent a representative from its Russia investigation team to a strategic intelligence briefing that intelligence officials gave to both the Clinton and Trump campaigns, including to Trump himself and aide Michael Flynn, who later became the administration’s national security adviser.\\nThe agent’s presence was a “pretext,” Horowitz said, to collect information that might be relevant for the investigation.\\nThe FBI debated but ultimately opted against giving a standard and more extensive defensive briefing that Russia might be trying to influence their campaign, fearful it could impede the ongoing counterintelligence investigation.\\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., suggested the FBI’s decision was reasonable, particularly because Flynn was himself under suspicion. He later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his interactions with Russia’s ambassador to the United States.\\nNonetheless, Horowitz said, “it raises significant policy questions.”\\nFBI Director Christopher Wray, who has said he accepts all the inspector general’s findings, is making changes on the briefing process. The FBI said that, going forward, briefings will be “solely intended to provide candidates” with relevant information and that FBI briefers will not be associated with any ongoing FBI investigation.\\nIn a blistering opening statement, the committee chairman, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said the code name for the FBI investigation, “Crossfire Hurricane,” was an apt title “because that’s what we ended up with — a ‘Crossfire Hurricane.’”\\n“What happened here is the system failed. People at the highest levels of government took the law into their own hands,” said Graham, a Trump ally.\\nSen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee’s top Democrat, said, “I believe strongly that it’s time to move on from the false claims of political bias.”\"], 'https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-trump/trump-picks-conservative-judge-kavanaugh-for-supreme-court-idUSKBN1JZ25A': ['reuters.com', 'Trump picks conservative judge Kavanaugh for Supreme Court', 'Lawrence Hurley, Steve Holland', datetime.datetime(2018, 7, 9, 16, 34, 14), 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh for the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday as he aimed to entrench its conservative control for years to come, but the federal appeals court judge faces a tough confirmation fight in the bitterly divided Senate.\\nWhile some Democrats promised a stern effort to block the 53-year-old Kavanaugh - who has served 12 years on the most influential U.S. appeals court - Trump’s fellow Republicans control the Senate by a narrow margin and can ensure confirmation if they avoid defections from their ranks.\\nIf confirmed, Kavanaugh would replace long-serving conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced his retirement on June 27 at age 81. Kavanaugh became Trump’s second lifetime appointment to the nation’s highest judicial body in his 18 months in office.\\nKavanaugh is a well-known figure in Washington and has been involved in some of the biggest controversies of the past two decades. He helped investigate Democratic former President Bill Clinton in the 1990s working for independent counsel Kenneth Starr. He was on Republican George W. Bush’s team in the contentious Florida recount fight in the 2000 presidential election, then served as a senior official in Bush’s White House.\\n“Throughout legal circles he’s considered a judge’s judge, a true thought leader among his peers,” Trump, who named conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch to the court last year, told an applauding audience in the White House East Room.\\n“He’s a brilliant jurist with a clear and effective writing style, universally regarded as one of the finest and sharpest legal minds of our time. And just like Justice Gorsuch, he excelled as a legal clerk for Justice Kennedy,” Trump added, saying Kavanaugh “deserves a swift confirmation and robust bipartisan support.”\\nThe appointment will not change the ideological breakdown of a court that already has a 5-4 conservative majority, but nevertheless could move the court to the right. Kennedy sometimes joined the liberal justices on key rulings on divisive social issues like abortion and gay rights, a practice his replacement may not duplicate.\\nKavanaugh has amassed a solidly conservative judicial record since 2006 on the influential U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the same court where three current justices including Chief Justice John Roberts previously served. Some conservative activists have questioned whether he would rule sufficiently aggressively as a justice.\\nLike the 50-year-old Gorsuch, Kavanaugh potentially could serve on the high court for decades. Trump’s other leading candidates for the post were fellow federal appellate judges Thomas Hardiman, Raymond Kethledge and Amy Coney Barrett.\\n“My judicial philosophy is straightforward: a judge must be independent and must interpret the law, not make the law. A judge must interpret statutes as written. And a judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history, and tradition and precedent,” Kavanaugh said during the ceremony in which he emphasized his family and his Roman Catholic faith.\\nKavanaugh survived a protracted confirmation fight after Bush picked nominated him to the appeals court in 2003. Some Democrats accused him of excessive partisanship, and it took three years before the Senate eventually voted to confirm him.\\nRepublicans hold a slim 51-49 Senate majority, and with ailing Senator John McCain battling cancer in his home state of Arizona they currently can muster only 50 votes. Senate rules still leave Democrats with scant options to block confirmation by themselves, though Trump must prevent Republican defections.\\nModerate Republican Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski said they could carefully vet Kavanaugh before deciding how to vote. Democratic senators serving in Republican-leaning states including Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota made similar remarks, though top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer blasted Trump’s pick.\\nSlideshow ( 11 images )\\n‘RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS’\\n“In selecting Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, President Trump has put reproductive rights and freedoms and healthcare protections for millions of Americans on the judicial chopping block,” Schumer said.\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who earlier in the day accused the “far left” of “scare tactics” to try to thwart the nomination, called Kavanaugh “a superb choice.”\\nSlideshow ( 11 images )\\nA White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Kavanaugh was informed on Sunday night he would be the nominee, adding that “what really tipped the scales was the consistency” the judge had shown on the appeals court.

Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter. ArrowRight For Trump, the conference represented his highest-profile broadside against Silicon Valley after months of accusations that tech giants censor conservative users and websites. With it, the president also rallied his widely followed online allies — whom he described as “journalists and influencers” and who together can reach roughly half a billion people — entering the 2020 presidential election.\\n“Some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable,” Trump said.\\nTrump delivered his diatribe against Facebook, Google and Twitter — charges of political bias that all three companies long have denied — at an event at the White House featuring Republican lawmakers, GOP campaign strategists and social media meme-makers, a move that led some critics to express dismay that the president aimed to use the policy summit as a reelection push.\\nSocial media changed the way presidents communicate with their citizens. Here’s how President Trump’s use of Twitter is shaping the office of the president. (Video: Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post)\\nBut Democratic lawmakers and watchdog groups said they were most alarmed that Trump had invited supporters who have a history of targeting the president’s political opponents with inflammatory tweets, misleading videos and hard-to-debunk conspiracy theories. At one point, the president praised James O’Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas, which has released widely criticized, highly edited videos of his subjects.\\nAdvertisement\\n“Somebody said he’s controversial,” Trump said. “He’s truthful.”\\nIn response, critics fretted that Trump had essentially endorsed such controversial tactics in the early days of the 2020 presidential race.\\n“This has the appearance not of a social media summit but a political rally and call for the right,” said Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.). “The fact that some of the most extreme voices on social media are coming to the White House, and they get a forum to complain about how often they’re retweeted, and that the actual platform companies aren’t even invited, smacks of the absurd.”\\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center charged that the president is “essentially conducting a hate summit at the White House,” said Heidi Beirich, the director of the group’s work to track online extremism.\\nFacebook, Google and Twitter each declined to comment.\\nAdvertisement\\nFor a portion of the summit, Twitter appeared to be down, an outage the company said it was investigating. Outside the gathering, Trump’s aides appeared to line the hallways with poster boards calling attention to the tech industry’s alleged tactics for suppressing conservatives’ speech — along with at least one tweet from Trump calling himself “the best” at using the service.\\nTrump also threatened additional scrutiny to come, promising to bring big tech companies to Washington for an upcoming meeting while directing federal agencies to explore “all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech.” During a later, private portion of the summit, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said she and her fellow Republicans are launching a special task force to probe big tech, with an early focus on issues including privacy.\\n“I’m hearing from so many people who are saying we need to put some guardrails in place,” she said. “And this is not an industry in its infancy.”\\nTrump has skewered Facebook, Google and Twitter for months on allegations that they are biased against conservatives, even accusing them of trying to rig the election. In March, for example, he said the companies had engaged in “collusion” and worked in opposition to a “certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election.” Repeatedly, the president also has threatened to investigate or regulate Facebook, Google and Twitter, sparking hearings and similar calls for tough new laws among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\\nAdvertisement\\nTrump has not provided evidence for his allegations that the tech companies seek to undermine Republicans or U.S. elections, and some of the examples he has cited to illustrate industry bias have been debunked. For instance, the president has accused Twitter of tampering with his follower count, a charge he repeated Thursday. The company long has said that users with large followings often experience fluctuations as it removes spam.\\n“A lot of bad things are happening,” he said.\\nTrump’s attacks often have come in response to efforts by Facebook, Google and Twitter to remove hate speech, threats of violence and other troubling content from their platforms. These tech giants have been under pressure to address a litany of online ills, including the rise of disinformation, three years after Russian agents spread falsehoods on social media during the 2016 election. But Trump and his close allies have decried some of social media’s content-moderation policies as censorship, putting those companies in a political bind.\\nAdvertisement\\n“This is largely, I think, a political event,” said Michael Beckerman, the president of the Internet Association, a Washington-based trade group that represents Facebook, Google and other tech giants. He said there is “no conservative bias on our platforms.”\\nSome of the conservatives that Trump consulted Thursday have adopted controversial tactics on social media and even have been disciplined by Facebook, Google or Twitter for running afoul of their rules. That includes O’Keefe and Project Veritas, whose secretly recorded video of Google drew Trump’s praise Thursday.\\n“Project Veritas can be synergistic with the Trump administration to pull back the curtain surrounding Big Tech,” O’Keefe said in a statement online after receiving the invitation.\\nOther attendees included Ali Alexander, who sent the initial inflammatory tweet questioning whether Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a Democratic presidential candidate, is actually an “American black,” and Jim Hoft, the Gateway Pundit founder who has long been faulted for spreading conspiracy theories online.\\nAdvertisement\\n“After the 2016 election Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon (in advertising) decided the best way to prevent another Trump win was to silence conservative voices in America,” according to a statement from the Gateway Pundit site. “The tech giants in two years did more to destroy Freedom of Speech than at any other time in US history.”\\nInitially, the White House had invited Ben Garrison, whose cartoons long have provoked the ire of groups including the Anti-Defamation League and Southern Poverty Law Center for including hateful imagery, including anti-Semitism. But the White House this week appeared to rescind its invitation, Garrison tweeted in a statement Wednesday, out of concern his presence would be a “media distraction from the president’s message.”\\nTrump also invited lawmakers such as Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) who have accused Twitter of limiting the reach of their tweets. They were joined by organizations such as the Media Research Center, a conservative group that has called for the breakup of big tech companies, and PragerU, which produces right-leaning videos that it says Google has censored — a matter the two sides are battling in court.\\nAdvertisement\\nIn an early-morning series of tweets, Trump said that the focus of the conversation would be “the tremendous dishonesty, bias, discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies,” though he did not mention any by name. “We will not let them get away with it much longer,” he added.\\nTrump also appeared to suggest social media sites “would be driven out of business” once he leaves office in six years — or more, acknowledging he had made a joke about exceeding presidential term limits.\\nSome lawmakers bristled at the summit, saying that the Trump administration had missed an opportunity to explore real challenges facing social media ahead of the 2020 election, amid heightened fears about the spread of hate speech and even harder-to-detect viral falsehoods.\\n“It’s not surprising that one of the loudest disseminators of misinformation is inviting known extremists and conspiracy theory peddlers to the White House social media summit,” tweeted Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), who leads the House’s top tech committee. “It’s a shame President Trump would prefer to fan the same fires of online social discord that Russia sparked in the 2016 election rather than bring real experts together to address the issue of content moderation in a thoughtful and rational manner.”\\nGiftOutline Gift Article'], 'http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/obama-trump-has-world-leaders-rattled-by-ignorance-cavalier-attitude-223595': ['politico.com', \"Obama: World leaders 'rattled' by Trump\", '', datetime.datetime(2016, 5, 26, 6, 11, 42), 'The president appeared to have more specifics to share in private.

The Trump administration and Republican Senate leadership have refused both requests.\\n“The Committee’s investigations did not cease with the House’s recent impeachment vote,” the House wrote to an appeals court on Monday.\\nBoth the House and the Justice Department on Monday wrote a series of arguments to the circuit court, addressing how the impeachment of the President affects both the House’s need for McGahn’s testimony and the Mueller details.\\nThe Justice Department, representing the White House and McGahn as well as its own interests, has broadly argued that the courts shouldn’t step in to give the House the information it seeks.\\nThe McGahn case\\nThe fight over McGahn’s testimony could either lead appeals courts to strike down or endorse the White House’s claims of absolute immunity for former and current officials who receive congressional subpoenas. That type of ruling could have major implications for a Senate trial, no matter its focus.\\nThe Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee said it has needed McGahn to testify and that it needed to review the Mueller grand jury information as part of possibly impeaching Trump for obstruction of justice.\\nBut Trump hasn’t been impeached for obstruction of justice – such as on the findings from Mueller that he attempted to obstruct the Russia investigation that came after McGahn gave key statements to criminal prosecutors.\\nTrump wasn’t charged with a crime, though Mueller outlined several legal reasons why Trump allegedly obstructed justice. Instead, the attorney general and then-deputy attorney general chose not to prosecute Trump.\\nThe House voted to impeach Trump for abuse of power related to his pressure on Ukraine for a political favor and for obstructing Congress, including not allowing former White House officials to testify, just like the White House has done with McGahn.\\nMcGahn has refused to testify to the House Judiciary Committee since April about what he witnessed Trump say and do regarding the Russia investigation. Mueller reported that McGahn spoke to prosecutors and the FBI several times about Trump’s direction to fire Mueller, among other things.\\n“Understanding President Trump’s history of obstruction would be important to the House’s presentation of the evidence and the Senate’s consideration of the second Article of Impeachment,” obstruction of Congress, the House wrote to the DC Circuit Court on Monday.\\n“For example, if McGahn confirms to the Committee that the President ordered him to fire Special Counsel Mueller—an event that President Trump has publicly disputed— and then tried to cover it up, that testimony would constitute powerful evidence of the pattern of obstructive behavior described in the second Article,” the House writes in the new filing in DC Circuit Court.\\nSeparately, “If McGahn’s testimony produces new evidence supporting the conclusion that President Trump committed impeachable offenses that are not covered by the Articles approved by the House, the Committee will proceed accordingly—including, if necessary, by considering whether to recommend new articles of impeachment,” the House wrote.\\nIf McGahn were ordered by a court to appear for congressional testimony under a subpoena, he may still be able to use the President’s assertions of executive privilege to decline to answer some questions.\\nThe Justice Department, representing McGahn, countered on Monday that the courts should stay out of the dispute.\\nIt’s especially problematic for the courts to resolve the testimony standoff, the Justice Department argues, while the Senate tries the President for obstructing Congress.\\n“Indeed, if this court now were to resolve the merits question in this case, it would appear to be weighing in on a contested issue in any impeachment trial. That would be of questionable propriety whether or not such a judicial resolution preceded or post-dated any impeachment trial,” the Justice Department wrote just after midnight early Monday. “The now very real possibility of this Court appearing to weigh in on an article of impeachment at a time when political tensions are at their highest levels – before, during, or after a Senate trial regarding the removal of a President – puts in stark relief why this sort of interbranch dispute is not one that has ‘traditionally thought to be capable of resolution through the judicial process.’”\\nPolitically, more articles of impeachment against Trump seem unlikely at this time.\\nBut in court, the House has argued to keep the McGahn case alive so it can keep its investigative options open and gather more information during the Senate trial.\\nThe Mueller details case\\nOn Monday, the House committee wrote that it wants the information collected by Mueller’s grand jury for the upcoming Senate impeachment trial. The information may speak to a “pattern of soliciting foreign election interference and obstructing government investigations of his misconduct.”\\nThe House added on Monday that its Judiciary Committee is considering legislation that could change how the White House and Justice Department interact regarding civil and criminal matters. The committee is also considering placing reporting requirements on “foreign offers of assistance,” according to the filing.\\nBut the Trump administration said the House should no longer need grand jury secrets following its impeachment vote last Wednesday.\\nTrump was impeached for his dealings with Ukraine and not his attempts to obstruct the Mueller investigation or other Russia-related findings, the Justice Department argued in another filing to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals Monday.\\n“Neither article of impeachment adopted by the House, however, alleges high crimes or misdemeanors stemming from the events described in the Mueller Report,” the Justice Department writes in its latest filing. “Accordingly, nothing appears to remain of the Committee’s alleged need for the grand-jury materials in the Mueller Report.”\\nPreviously, the House highlighted that it wants the grand jury details, such as testimony from the convicted former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, because transcripts and other documents could show Trump lied to Mueller about his knowledge of his political adviser’s efforts with WikiLeaks during the campaign.\\nThe court filings on Monday come in two of the most potentially significant court cases that could be resolved during Trump’s impeachment proceedings. Both the McGahn and grand jury secrets cases are set to be heard by three-judge panels on January 3 at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington.\\nThe House won both cases in the lower court.\\nHistorically, federal courts try to stay out of clashes between the executive branch and Congress, or Congress and the Justice Department have negotiated before an appeals court settled disputes over administration witnesses. Yet a trial-level judge in Washington, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, ruled in late November that McGahn would have to testify. The White House couldn’t claim a blanket immunity to override a congressional subpoena of a former official, the judge wrote.\\nSeparately, Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court wrote that the House’s investigation of the President was valid, and in some ways continued the work of the Mueller grand jury.

You have the whistleblower complaint. You have the letter from the ICIG. You have the Office of Legal Counsel opinion and you have the transcript from the president.”\\nMaguire also stressed that the complaint was essentially \"hearsay\" and not “corroborated by other folks.”\\n“This is second-hand information. I am not criticizing the whistleblower,” Maguire said. “... I am in no position to tell the committee to do an investigation or not to do an investigation.”\\nSchiff vowed at the end \"we are gonna find out\" the backstory, including whether U.S. aid was tied in any way to Trump\\'s investigation request, which the president denies.\\nThe combative conclusion of the session reflected the high tensions and enormous stakes surrounding Maguire\\'s appearance. The rare open hearing of the intelligence committee commanded Washington\\'s political attention given the implications for the newly launched impeachment inquiry against Trump, related to the whistleblower complaint.\\nShortly after the hearing ended, Trump fired back on Twitter, saying: “Adam Schiff has zero credibility. Another fantasy to hurt the Republican Party!”\\nHe told reporters that the process is a “disgrace,” defended his Ukraine call as “absolutely perfect” and accused Democrats of bringing any legislative progress to a standstill.\\n“They’re frozen, the Democrats,” he said.\\nMaguire\\'s reputation was also on trial Thursday. He has come under fire from Democrats for initially withholding a copy of the complaint from lawmakers. That standoff was technically resolved when the complaint was declassified, and released to the public, in advance of the hearing. But Maguire was still pressed for answers from Democratic committee members on why his office did not hand over the complaint at first.\\nMaguire insisted he is \"not partisan\" and \"not political,\" reminding the panel that he served under eight presidents and has taken the oath of office 11 times.\\n\"I have served and led through turbulent times,\" he said. \"... My integrity has never been questioned until now.\"\\nHowever, he maintained, \"I believe that I handled this matter in full compliance with the law at all times.”\\nAt one point in the hearing, during a tense exchange with Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., about allegations in the complaint of a potential “cover-up” regarding the Ukraine call, Maguire pushed back again by reminding the committee that the complaint was not based on direct knowledge.\\n“This is second-hand information from a whistleblower. I have no knowledge if that is a true and accurate statement,” Maguire said regarding the “cover-up” claim. The complaint said White House officials tried to “lock down” records of the call. In the same document, the whistleblower also acknowledged not being a “direct witness” to most of the events described, instead citing other U.S. officials who are not named.\\nRepublican members also jumped to Maguire\\'s defense at the hearing, while accusing Democrats of launching an \"information warfare operation\" against Trump. Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, said of Maguire: \"I think you\\'re nuts if you\\'re going to convince the American people that your cause is just by attacking this man, by impugning his character.\"\\nSchiff, meanwhile, questioned Maguire over the timeline of his cooperation with the committee. Maguire said he was not able to release the document at first because of executive privilege concerns and other issues. He also said he is not aware of any instance where such a complaint dealt with such \"complicated and sensitive issues.\"\\n\"I believe that this matter is unprecedented,\" he testified.

Instead, the transcript was allegedly kept on a different system normally used for classified information.\\nWHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT HAS BEEN DECLASSIFIED AND CONTAINS NO \\'SURPRISES,\\' GOP LAWMAKER SAYS\\nMeanwhile, Republicans on the committee, including Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., accused Democrats of orchestrating a public spectacle.\\n\"I want to congratulate the Democrats on the rollout of their latest information warfare operation against the president, and their extraordinary ability once again to enlist the mainstream media in their campaign,\" Nunes said, adding that “we’ve been treated to an unending parade of press releases, press conferences, and fake news stories.”\\n\"The released transcript of the call has already debunked that central assertion, but that didn\\'t matter,\" he continued. \"The Democrats simply moved the goalposts and began claiming that there doesn\\'t need to be a quid pro quo for this conversation to serve as the basis for impeaching the president.\"\\nThe White House, on Wednesday, released an unclassified version of the transcript of that controversial phone call. The memo, which does not reflect a “verbatim transcript” but is based on “notes and recollections” of those memorializing the call, shows Trump congratulating Zelensky on his election victory before Trump eventually gets to the subject of the Bidens, seeking an investigation of some kind.\\nMaguire says that the whistleblower complaint released Thursday \"is in alignment with what was released yesterday by the president.\"\\nTrump first asked Zelensky to do a \"favor\" and “find out what happened” with the hacking of the DNC server in 2016. He referenced CrowdStrike, a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks.\\nThen, Trump went on to seek assistance in investigating the Bidens.\\n“The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”\\nThis refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.\\nDEMS DOUBLE DOWN ON IMPEACHMENT AFTER UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE\\nWhile the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to “look into” the Bidens, it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid — which had been frozen days earlier, a detail that fueled impeachment calls earlier this week and helped prompt House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday.\\nHours after the transcript was released, Trump met with Zelensky on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. Reporters asked Zelensky about the call with Trump, and whether he felt pressured by the U.S. president, as alleged by the whistleblower—an accusation he denied.\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n“I think you read everything.

The Earth is getting warmer. Human activity is largely responsible.\\nWhen people talk about the “97 percent” consensus among international scientists, this is the fundamental issue to which they’re referring. Where the consensus starts to disappear is when it comes to more specific questions and predictions – how much and how quickly will temperature rise? What will the effects be for specific regions?

Meanwhile, there’s Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly called climate change a hoax and has suggested that it was invented by China to hurt U.S. competitiveness. I wish I could say that this puts him outside the mainstream of his party, but it doesn’t.\\n2. \"Denying the Climate Catastrophe,\" a 9-part series by Warren Meyer, author of the blog \"Climate Skeptic\"\\nWell, this notion that the ‘debate is over’ is one of those statements that is both true and not true. There is something approaching scientific consensus for certain parts of anthropogenic global warming theory…. But it turns out that other propositions that are important to the debate on man-made global warming are far less understood scientifically, and the near certainty on a few issues (like the existence of the greenhouse gas effect) is often used to mask real questions about these other propositions.\\n3. \"\\'The Sixth Extinction’ by Elizabeth Kolbert,\" Al Gore’s review of this 2014 Pulitzer Prize-winning book\\nSince the origin of life on earth 3.8 billion years ago, our planet has experienced five mass extinction events. The last of these events occurred some 66 million years ago when a six-mile-wide asteroid is thought to have collided with earth, wiping out the dinosaurs....Today, Kolbert writes, we are witnessing a similar mass extinction event happening in the geologic blink of an eye. According to E. O. Wilson, the present extinction rate in the tropics is ‘on the order of 10,000 times greater than the naturally occurring background extinction rate’ and will reduce biological diversity to its lowest level since the last great extinction. This time, however, a giant asteroid isn’t to blame — we are, by altering environmental conditions on our planet so swiftly and dramatically that a large proportion of other species cannot adapt.\\n4. \"Climate Change Recalculated,\" by Saul Griffith, engineer and MacArthur Fellow\\nGriffith has done the research and the math to figure out exactly what it will take for humanity to soften the impact of climate change in the next 25 years, and he lays it out in a dazzling presentation.

The question is, will Tehran be more cooperative in the search for solutions to these conflicts if the signatories to the Iran deal, especially the U.S., fully adhere to it, or will Iran add fuel to the regional fires because the deal is terminated by Trump if Congress fails to reach a drastically different accord?\\nBy all accounts, Iran continues to fully adhere to all the provisions of the deal. The irony is that when the U.S. finally makes a deal after years of mutually intense enmity following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, it reneges on it, which only reinforces the Iranians’ belief that the U.S. cannot be trusted and is still committed to regime change.\\nAlthough the deal was limited to Iran’s pursuit of a weaponized nuclear program, it offers opportunities to build on it in the search for solutions to the regional conflicts, especially Iran’s continuing transgressions. Trump’s reckless decision will take away any incentive that could entice Iran to be a positive regional player.\\nAdvertisement\\nI am not condoning Iran’s reprehensible behavior. I condemn in the strongest terms its support of violent extremists and terrorist organizations; I condemn it for being one of the most vicious culprits behind Syria’s tragic civil war and its ruthless support of the Houthis in Yemen, the Shiite insurgents in Iraq and Hezbollah in Lebanon. That said, Iran cannot simply be dismissed as if it were irrelevant to the unfolding tragic events in the region, which cannot be resolved without Iran’s full participation.\\nThose who deal with Iran will do well to remember that there is a psychological dimension to Iran’s behavior. Iran is a major Middle Eastern power; it is a proud nation with a rich, millennia-long history and huge human and natural resources, enjoying a critical geo-strategic position and importance unmatched by any other country in the region.\\nThis of course does not excuse Iran’s behavior, but given its deeply-rooted national pride, it does not respond well to intimidation and threats. Now that Iran is in full compliance with the deal that was negotiated in good faith by the Obama administration, Tehran enhanced its credibility and stature in the eyes of the international community. Sadly, the same cannot be said about the Trump administration.\\nWhy should Tehran agree to renegotiate the deal when the EU, Russia, and China remain committed to it as it stands? Last Monday the European Union backed the accord, saying that, “The EU is committed to the continued full and effective implementation of all parts of the [agreement]” because it is working and is a key part of nuclear non-proliferation efforts. Risking the Iran deal will isolate the U.S. rather than Iran because the U.S. is the party who is violating the spirit and letter of the agreement.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe likelihood that Congress would modify the agreement to make it palatable to Trump is extremely slim and will open the door for Iran to back out of the deal and resume its development of its nuclear program, which will inevitably lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\\nIf Trump is true to his word and terminates the deal completely, it would trigger the re-imposition of sanctions against the will of our European allies, which will only widen their rift with the U.S. as they are determined not to follow Trump’s misguided and incongruous policy.\\nFor a president who is naïve about foreign relations and the implications of terminating the deal to refuse to listen to the advice of his national security team (including Defense Secretary Mattis) that the deal serves U.S. national security interests is astonishing.\\nInstead, Trump is listening to Israel’s Prime Minister Netanyahu, who is ignoring the fact that once the deal is terminated Iran will be free to resume its nuclear program, which could potentially pose a serious threat to Israel’s national security that he wants to prevent. Moreover, he looks at Iran through the narrowest of lenses, as if Tehran responds only to the language of force and sanctions, which is beyond the pale of idiocy.\\nEven if Iran is determined to acquire nuclear weapons somewhere down the line, which should not be overruled, to suggest that its intention is to destroy Israel or any other U.S. ally in the region is absurd. Tehran is deliberate, careful, and rational; it knows that once it embarks on developing nuclear weapons, Israel, the U.S., or both will use any means (including military force) to prevent it from achieving its goal. Indeed, however hardline Iran might be, the regime is not suicidal.\\nAdvertisement\\nAny modification to the deal should first be attempted through diplomatic channels. That is, if the purpose is to prevent Iran from pursuing a weaponized nuclear program once the current deal expires, then why not engage Iran now in quiet diplomacy (notwithstanding its vocal public opposition) and gauge where it really stands and what sort of quid pro quo Tehran would seek to modify the agreement.\\nTo be sure, in the search for a solution to the conflict with Tehran, the U.S. must seek areas where there is mutuality of interests that serve both sides well. The raging conflicts in the Middle East provide opportunities to work with Iran to bring an end to the civil war in Syria, to mitigate the conflict in Yemen, and even cooperate on addressing violent extremism and radicalization. Yes, Iran does seek regional hegemony, but as long as it is treated with respect and feels assured that the US is not seeking regime change now or at any time in the future, it would tamper its ambitions.\\nTrump’s thoughtless and damaging campaign promise to tear up the Iran deal on his first day in office did nothing but embarrass the U.S., rather than demonstrate what he foolishly keeps repeating—that the deal itself was the worst deal the U.S. has ever made.\\nIf Republican Senators and House members have any spine left, they should stop behaving like a cult that blindly follows a blind leader and pass a bill that would prevent Trump from terminating the deal, similar to the one they passed that usurped from Trump the power to lift the sanctions on Russia by executive order.\\nCongress may be able to modify the deal, but losing the support of our allies – who are determined to keep the deal in place and refuse to reimpose the sanctions on Iran – would be the greatest embarrassment to what’s left of America’s leadership.'], 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/06/21/trumps-iran-reversal-exposes-one-his-most-dangerous-lies/': ['washingtonpost.com', 'Opinion | Trump’s Iran reversal exposes one of his most dangerous lies', 'Greg Sargent', datetime.datetime(2019, 6, 21, 14, 45, 32), 'Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\\nThe news that President Trump ordered strikes on Iran, only to reverse himself at the last minute, provides an occasion to revisit the big story that Trump told in the course of getting elected to the most powerful position on Earth. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight That story went a little something like this.\\nTrump grasped the festering popular discontent over multiple catastrophic elite failures that their architects were entirely oblivious to as they tittered away in their coastal enclaves. Trump would smash the elite consensus on immigration and globalization, no longer subjecting U.S. workers to the competition from unskilled migrants and foreign sweatshop-wage workers that had wreaked “carnage” on the Appalachian and industrial Midwestern heartlands.\\nAnd Trump would end the elite consensus on foreign policy that had mired young men and women from those forsaken places in faraway Forever Wars that represented the height of elite hubris and folly.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe latest Iran news exposes one of the most important, and potentially most destructive, false narratives at the core of that whole story.\\nFollow Greg Sargent \\'s opinions Follow\\nAs Trump just confirmed on Twitter, he had ordered strikes as a response to Iran’s shooting down of a surveillance drone, but cancelled the attack only “10 minutes before the strike.” He did this after learning it could result in 150 deaths, which he called “not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone.”\\nSo, let’s give Trump qualified credit here: It does appear he’s resisting the push for war from the administration’s hawks. (Another explanation is that he thinks Iranian capitulation is inevitable anyway, as will be discussed below.)\\nThis seeming instinct against war, if it exists, is often presented as signaling a “contradiction,\" one that pits this reluctance against his desire to look “tough” in international affairs. That reluctance is said to be grounded in the story he told in 2016 — in his “nationalist” and “America First\" aversion to pouring U.S. blood and treasure down foreign sinkholes.\\nAdvertisement\\nBut in this particular case, it’s precisely because the story he told is completely false that Trump is trapped in that contradiction right now — and we are trapped in an escalating situation with potentially horrible consequences.\\nTrump’s story about Iran has always been a lie\\nAs many observers have noted — see this from Evelyn Farkas, or this Post editorial — it is Trump’s decision to pull out of the international nuclear deal negotiated by President Barack Obama that has led to this moment.\\nThe short version: Iran was abiding by the deal, and was being constrained from developing nuclear weapons. But Trump pulled out — then reimposed sanctions to choke the Iranian economy, and has since dictated terms for sanctions relief that appear deliberately unrealistic, cornering Iran into a choice between escalating on its side or submitting entirely to those terms.\\nAdvertisement\\nAs David Ignatius explains, the administration is confident that this submission is right around the corner, but this would require “total capitulation.” The continued push for this makes miscalculation — and war — more likely.\\nBut let’s focus on the original withdrawal from the deal. In the run-up to that decision, Trump falsely claimed Iran was on the verge of total collapse before Obama negotiated it, and overinflated what Iran financially got from it, to falsely portray it as a giveaway to Iran. Trump also insisted the deal was premised on believing Iran could be trusted not to develop nukes (in fact, it had strict verification mechanisms) and that the deal would inevitably fail to constrain Iran.\\nThat latter claim proved completely false for a time, as Iran continued to abide by it. Now Iran is suggesting it will restart its programs, but this is coming after the United States pulled out of the deal that was successfully constraining it, compounding the folly of Trump’s decision.\\nAdvertisement\\nTrump’s claim that the deal was hopelessly weak — which has been revealed as false by events, though one cannot conclusively say it would have worked forever — probably derived from the fact that Trump couldn’t bear that Obama had negotiated it. Trump treated it as weak by definition.\\nBut there’s a deeper deception here, one that goes back to the whole story Trump tells.\\nThe deeper deception\\nHow did Trump square his campaign vow to pull out of the nuclear deal with his promise to avoid Mideast quagmires? By claiming not just that elites were foolishly sinking us into such quagmires but also that our elites were weak and allowing other countries to take us to the cleaners. Trump’s vow to withdraw was a sign of his strength — he’d be “tougher” with Iran, unilaterally so, and force its full capitulation (without any shots fired) that way.\\nAdvertisement\\nAs Zack Beauchamp has exhaustively demonstrated, Trump has never really been averse to military adventurism in any deeply committed sense. What he campaigned on was much closer to hawkish nationalism — he blustered for years about using force unilaterally. As we’re now seeing, this is manifesting itself in open hostility to international compromise solutions.\\nThe Iran deal was and is imperfect — designed to constrain Iran, not through total capitulation to all our demands, but through a painstakingly negotiated international compromise.\\nIt was working. But Trump’s worldview did not permit acknowledgment of this. Now he’s making good on his vow to achieve total capitulation through toughness, and we’re living through the deeply risky consequences.\\nWe should hope Trump really is reluctant to go to war, and that this reluctance will prevail. But the terrible thing here is that, despite the story Trump told about elite failure, the Iran deal was one case in which international elites actually did set up a framework that likely would have averted senseless, costly foreign quagmires. In other words, here they got a very big thing right.\\nRead more:\\nGiftOutline Gift Article'], 'https://nypost.com/2019/09/09/in-walking-away-from-taliban-deal-trump-showed-wisdom-obama-never-had/': ['nypost.com', 'In walking away from Taliban deal, Trump showed wisdom Obama never had', 'Social Links For Jonathan S.

Presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar said Trump was conducting foreign policy as if it were “a game show.”\\nBut the bottom line about Trump’s decision is that it was correct.\\nNegotiating with the Taliban is a bitter pill for Americans to swallow. These brutal Islamist killers have the blood of nearly 2,000 Americans on their hands, as well as that of countless numbers of Afghans. But after nearly 18 years of a stalemated war and a doomed effort to democratize Afghanistan, the administration was obligated to seek an alternative.\\nThe goal of the talks was clear.\\nYet this is not just an obscure fight that warmongering hawks dragged the country into. American security is on the line there, since the first objective must be to guarantee that Afghanistan will never again serve as a haven for terrorists as it did for al Qaeda before 9/11.\\nIt’s also important for Washington to not sign a deal that will allow it to betray the Afghan government. Nor should we let the Taliban take over all of the country and return its tortured people to medieval barbarity after a decent interval has passed between the American withdrawal and the return of the Islamists to power in Kabul.\\nFor the United States to be complicit in a scheme that will allow the women and children of that country to be abandoned to the tender mercies of Taliban murderers would be a dishonorable conclusion to this longest of all of our wars.\\nIs it possible for Washington to satisfy both of those concerns? That remains to be seen, but Trump shouldn’t be faulted for trying even if the effort is doomed to failure.\\nSome Democrats are also arguing that Trump’s blaming of the collapse of the talks on last week’s car bomb attack that cost the life of a US soldier was an excuse that covered up his uncertainty about whether a potential agreement with the Taliban was the right thing to do.\\nBut whether or not that is true — and it’s clear that the Taliban have no intention of stopping their terrorist attacks — Trump was right to call a halt to the entire exercise once he understood that the outcome would neither ensure America’s security nor those of the people he’s proposing to leave behind.\\nThe problem here is not Trump’s theatrical style but a process that doesn’t seem likely to accomplish anything but give the United States a diplomatic fig leaf to cover up a desire to bug out and leave a mess behind that will soon come back to bite us.\\nWe have two recent examples of a president conducting foreign policy in a more conventional manner with terrible results.\\nPresident Barack Obama was so desperate for a nuclear deal with Iran at any price that he accepted one that didn’t ensure Tehran would never get a nuclear weapon or use the wealth it received in exchange for the agreement to fund terrorism and various hostile foreign adventures.\\nSimilarly Obama was so eager to proclaim that he had ended the war in Iraq with a stroke of his pen that he didn’t consider the consequences of a unilateral withdrawal. The resulting power vacuum he left behind led to the rise of ISIS and more suffering and bloodshed.\\nHowever he arrived at his decision, Trump seems to have belatedly realized he was mistaken and, in contrast to Obama’s arrogance, pulled the plug on a disaster in the making before it was too late.\\nWhile a dramatic gesture like holding talks at Camp David appealed to Trump, it was still a mistake. Canceling it was the beginning of wisdom.\\nThere’s more to achieving America’s objectives or ending a war where the other side intends to go on fighting than signing a piece of paper. President Trump’s pull-back from the brink of repeating Obama’s mistakes may strike Democrats as undignified, but it is far better than sticking with a deal that would have been a humiliating defeat for US interests.\\nJonathan Tobin is editor in chief of JNS.org and a contributor to National Review.'], 'https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-dept-face-off-against-trump-legal-team-over-seized-records-2022-09-01/': ['reuters.com', 'U.S. judge signals willingness to appoint special master in Trump search case', \"Francisco Alvarado Sarah N.

Before he left, he remarked that the nerve-gas attack recently carried out on a former Russian spy in Salisbury, England, was a “really egregious act,” but he also said it wasn’t entirely clear who was responsible. Later on Monday, though, the State Department issued a statement in which Tillerson expressed his “full confidence” in the British government’s assessment that the Russian state was almost certainly the culprit. (In the House of Commons on Monday, Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, said it was “highly likely” that Russia was responsible.)\\n“There is never a justification for this type of attack—the attempted murder of a private citizen on the soil of a sovereign nation—and we are outraged that Russia appears to have again engaged in such behavior,” Tillerson’s statement said. “From Ukraine to Syria—and now the UK—Russia continues to be an irresponsible force of instability in the world, acting with open disregard for the sovereignty of other states and the life of their citizens. We agree that those responsible—both those who committed the crime and those who ordered it—must face appropriately serious consequences. We stand in solidarity with our Allies in the United Kingdom and will continue to coordinate closely our responses.”\\nThis was arguably the strongest condemnation of Russian behavior that the Trump Administration has ever issued. And it turned out to be one of Tillerson’s final official acts as Secretary of State. At 8:44 A.M. on Tuesday, Donald Trump announced Tillerson’s firing on Twitter. “Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State,” Trump wrote. “He will do a fantastic job! Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service! Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all!”\\nSome of Trump’s aides immediately insisted to reporters that the President hadn’t dismissed Tillerson because of the Russia statement. Citing multiple White House officials, the Washington Post reported that the White House informed the Secretary of State on Friday that he was going to be ousted. Zeke Miller, of the Associated Press, subsequently filled out this narrative, reporting via Twitter, “WH official says chief of staff John Kelly called Tillerson Friday and again on Saturday. Both calls to Tillerson, the official says, warned that Trump was about to take imminent action if he did not step aside. When Tillerson didn’t act, Trump fired him.” In brief remarks to reporters, Trump said he had been thinking about replacing Tillerson for “a long time,” because “We were not thinking the same.” He also said Tillerson “will be much happier now.”\\nAt least one of Tillerson’s aides pushed back against this White House narrative, however. Elise Labott, CNN’s global-affairs correspondent, reported that Tillerson only found out from Trump’s tweet that he was fired. Josh Lederman, of the A.P., reported, via Twitter, “We got off the plane with Tillerson less than four hours ago. There was zero indication on flight home that this was imminent.” The White House reacted quickly to this counter-narrative. By early afternoon, the White House had fired the aide, Steve Goldstein, who contradicted its version of what had happened.\\nIf Tillerson did know that the President was about to can him, his statement on Russia was perhaps a final act of defiance. On Tuesday, the Russian government again denied responsibility for the attack in Salisbury and said it wouldn’t respond to British claims unless it was provided with samples of the nerve agent used. Trump also spoke with May, finally, and, after the call, the White House issued a statement saying he agreed with her “that the Government of the Russian Federation must provide unambiguous answers regarding how this chemical weapon, developed in Russia, came to be used in the United Kingdom.” However, the statement stopped short of saying Trump agreed with the British assessment that the Russian government was very likely responsible.\\nIt is certainly true that Tillerson’s departure wasn’t entirely unexpected. Although he has avoided criticizing Trump publicly, behind the scenes the former ExxonMobil C.E.O. hasn’t hidden his contempt for the President. Last summer, after Trump gave a wacko speech to the Boy Scouts of America, an organization Tillerson used to lead, Tillerson reportedly came close to resigning. In October, NBC News reported that after a meeting at which Trump called for a tenfold increase in the U.S. nuclear arsenal, Tillerson referred to him as a “moron” in a conversation with other officials. One of the NBC reporters would clarify that Tillerson used the term “fucking moron.”\\nAfter those revelations, which Tillerson didn’t explicitly deny, there were frequent suggestions that Trump was considering replacing him with Pompeo, a former Republican congressman. Despite this acrimony, the fact remains that Trump announced Tillerson’s firing barely twelve hours after he had forcefully sided with the British government against the Kremlin. Either Trump decided that Tillerson’s show of defiance was the last straw, or he was oblivious (or indifferent) to the impression that firing him at this juncture would create.\\nTo be sure, there were policy differences between Trump and Tillerson—many of them. In addition to the Iranian nuclear deal, where Tillerson was more supportive than the President, trade and North Korea come to mind immediately. Last week, Tillerson reportedly warned White House officials that Trump’s proposal to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports would endanger U.S. national security. On Thursday, just hours before Trump agreed to meet with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Tillerson told the reporters travelling with him in Africa, “We’re a long way from negotiations.”\\nMaybe that’s why Trump decided to act now, although it wouldn’t explain why he waited five days and then made the announcement on Twitter. It’s also possible that another factor played into his timing. Early Tuesday morning, the Washington Post reported that Roger Stone, the Republican dirty trickster and longtime Trump adviser, told an associate in the spring of 2016 that “he had learned from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange that his organization had obtained emails that would torment senior Democrats such as John Podesta, then campaign chairman for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.” This conversation took place “before it was publicly known that hackers had obtained the emails of Podesta and of the Democratic National Committee,” the story also noted.\\nAs Reince Priebus, the former White House chief of staff, told Fox News’s Laura Ingraham, Trump pays a great deal of attention to how the daily news narrative evolves. After the Post’s scoop appeared, other news organizations leapt on it, and Stone’s name trended on Twitter. In all likelihood, the Post’s story, with its implication of possible collusion, would have dominated the day in cable news. But once the news of Tillerson’s firing broke, it slipped down the home pages, and Stone dropped off the trending list.\\nWhatever really happened, the fact is that Tillerson is gone—the first Cabinet secretary ever to be fired by tweet. Given his effort to gut the State Department, and the departure of many senior diplomats with distinguished careers in the department, Tillerson’s fall likely won’t be lamented in Foggy Bottom, or in many other places. But in the unique and alarming context of this Presidency, he seemed like a stabilizing and independent-minded presence. At least, he wasn’t a Trump flunky or a Bannonite ethno-nationalist.\\nWith Tillerson’s departure so closely following the resignation of Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive who served as Trump’s senior economic adviser, the circle around the President is getting even tighter. Pompeo, Tillerson’s replacement, is a Trump loyalist who has tried to downplay Russian interference in the 2016 election. And so it goes on.\\nThis post has been updated to include the details of President Trump’s call to British Prime Minister Theresa May.

ISIS. For reasons known only to Trump, he continued to repeat false statements that have been repeatedly debunked in the past. So here’s a roundup of some of the more notable claims made in the speech. As is our practice, we don’t award Pinocchios in roundups, but readers by now should be able to tell the real whoppers.\\n“This summer there’s been an ISIS attack launched outside the war zones of the Middle East — hard to believe — every 84 hours.”\\nThis number comes from IntelCenter, a private counterterrorism intelligence company, but the time frame that Trump uses is cherry-picked.\\nThe group’s data from June 8 to July 20, 2016, have gotten attention for the number of terrorist attacks directed or inspired by ISIS: one attack every 84 hours. That’s why Trump says that’s how many attacks there have been “this summer,” though the data cover approximately six weeks of the summer so far. CNN reported that the group’s count mirrors the outlet’s tracking data, but it’s just a brief snapshot.\\nAdvertisement\\nIntelCenter has tracked attacks since the Islamic State announced its “caliphate” in June 2014. Since then, there have been 76 attacks in 21 countries, killing 966 and injuring 2,812, the website says. Those data cover June 29, 2014, to Aug. 6, 2016. That means there were about three attacks every month over the 26 months covered by the data.\\n“The rise of ISIS is the direct result of policy decisions made by President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton.”\\nThis is false and facile. The terrorist group is the direct result of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, as we explored in our interview with Washington Post reporter Joby Warrick, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his book on the rise of the Islamic State. (Trump, of course, supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003.) At best, one could argue that actions that Obama failed to take (over Clinton’s opposition) helped contribute to the growth of ISIS.\\n“Iran, the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with $150 billion in cash released by the United States.”\\nTrump always makes it sound like this is U.S. taxpayer money — and he always uses a too-high estimate. Because of international sanctions over its nuclear program, Iran had billions of dollars in assets that were frozen in foreign banks around the globe. With sanctions lifted, in theory those funds would be unlocked.\\nAdvertisement\\nBut the Treasury Department has estimated that once Iran fulfills other obligations, it would have about $55 billion left. (Much of the other money was obligated to illiquid projects in China.) For its part, the Central Bank of Iran said the number was actually $32 billion, not $55 billion.\\n“It all began in 2009 with what has become known as President Obama’s global ‘Apology Tour.’”\\nTrump resurrects an old — and discredited — Republican talking point. His prepared text even cited an April 2009 article written by Karl Rove as its source. As we demonstrated more than five years ago, Rove took Obama’s quotes out of context and twisted their meaning in order to build a tendentious case. The whole notion of an Obama apology tour was a fiction from the start — and was worthy of Four Pinocchios.\\n“The failures in Iraq were compounded by Hillary Clinton’s disaster in Libya. President Obama has since said he regards Libya as his worst mistake.”\\nFirst of all, Trump was a fervent advocate of intervening in Libya. On a video uncovered by BuzzFeed, Trump declared in 2011: “Gaddafi in Libya is killing thousands of people. Nobody knows how bad it is, and we’re sitting around. We have soldiers all over the Middle East, and we’re not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage, and that’s what it is: It’s a carnage …. Now, we should go in, we should stop this guy, which would be very easy and very quick.”\\nAdvertisement\\nSecond, Trump misquotes Obama. In the quote cited by the Trump campaign, Obama said that intervening was “the right thing to do.” What he regretted as his worst mistake was failing to plan for “the day after.”\\n“I was an opponent of the Iraq War from the beginning — a major difference between me and my opponent.”\\nWhat will it take for Trump to just admit that he had supported the Iraq invasion before he opposed it, after the invasion already took place? This is yet another Four Pinocchio claim.\\nThere is no sign that Trump made headlines about his vocal Iraq War stance in 2003, nor that Trump clearly opposed the Iraq War prior to the invasion. We compiled a complete timeline of his comments leading up to the invasion and found that his comments were not “loud,” “clear” nor in “headlines” as he repeatedly claimed on the campaign trail.\\nYet Trump continues to use this line, even though numerous news outlets have debunked it. This time, Trump cherry-picked his own quote to back up his claim: “Three months before the invasion, I said in an interview with Neil Cavuto … that perhaps we shouldn’t be doing it yet. And that the economy is a much bigger problem.”\\nAdvertisement\\nHe was referring to a January 2003 interview on Fox Business, about two months before the invasion. During it, Trump gave a lukewarm reaction to the Iraq invasion and urged then-President George W. Bush to make a decision. Below is the context for that claim. As readers can see, Trump did not weigh in on whether the United States should attack or not (“either you attack or you don’t attack”).\\nCavuto: If you had to sort of break down for the president, if you were advising him, how much time do you commit to Iraq versus how much time you commit to the economy, what would you say?\\nTrump: Well, I’m starting to think that people are much more focused now on the economy. They are getting a little bit tired of hearing, we’re going in, we’re not going in, the — you know, whatever happened to the days of the Douglas MacArthur. He would go and attack. He wouldn’t talk. We have to — you know, it’s sort like either do it or don’t do it. When I watch Dan Rather explaining how we are going to be attacking, where we’re going to attack, what routes we’re taking, what kind of planes we’re using, how to stop them, how to stop us, it is a little bit disconcerting. I’ve never seen this, where newscasters are telling you how — telling the enemy how we’re going about it, we have just found out this and that. It is ridiculous.\\nCavuto: Well, the problem right there.\\nTrump: Either you attack or you don’t attack.\\nCavuto: The problem there, Donald, is you’re watching Dan Rather. Maybe you should just be watching Fox.\\nTrump: Well, no, I watch Dan Rather, but not necessarily fondly. But I happened to see it the other night. And I must tell you it was rather amazing as they were explaining the different — I don’t know if it is fact or if it is fiction, but the concept of a newscaster talking about the routes is — just seems ridiculous. So the point is either you do it or you don’t do it, or you — but I just — or if you don’t do it, just don’t talk about it. When you do it, you start talking about it.\\nCavuto: So you’re saying the leash on this is getting kind of short here, that the president has got to do something presumably sooner rather than later and stringing this along could ultimately hurt us.\\nTrump: Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn’t be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He’s under a lot of pressure. He’s — I think he’s doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.\\n“In August of 2004, very early, right after the conflict, I made a detailed statement to Esquire magazine in an interview [opposing the invasion].”\\nTrump clearly was outspoken about his opposition to the Iraq War starting in 2004, the year he reportedly considered a presidential bid. (Instead, he launched his popular TV series, “The Apprentice.”) Trump did sharply criticize the war in Iraq in the August 2004 cover story of Esquire magazine. But this was nearly 18 months after the invasion in March 2003.\\nTrump also has pointed several times to a July 2004 Reuters article as proof he opposed the war from the outset. The Reuters article is a preview of the August 2004 Esquire cover story. Somehow, in Trump’s mind, 2004 has turned into 2003, and Trump now says he “was against the war from the very beginning,” even prior to the March 2003 invasion.\\nAdvertisement\\n“But I have been just as clear in saying what a catastrophic mistake Hillary Clinton and President Obama made with the reckless way in which they pulled out.”\\nTrump criticizes the 2011 withdrawal of combat troops from Iraq, saying Obama “got us out the wrong way.” But Trump supported rapid withdrawal as early as March 2007, saying the United States should “declare victory and leave.” So once again Trump criticizes Obama and Clinton for taking action he advocated.\\n“I have long said that we should have kept the oil in Iraq.”\\nThis is nonsensical. The Bush administration invested a lot of diplomatic effort in assuring Middle Eastern allies that the United States was not invading because of Iraq’s oil fields. Moreover, oil revenue was crucial to ensuring a functioning Iraqi state — which is why insurgents often targeted the oil sector in Iraq.\\nIn any event, seizing the oil of a sovereign nation after invading it would be considered a “grave breach” of the Geneva Conventions, one of the cornerstones of international law, as well as other international agreements. Maybe Trump’s staff should arrange a tutorial on international law.\\nAdvertisement\\n“I had previously said that NATO was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism. Since my comments, they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats.”\\nNATO has disputed Trump’s repeated claim that NATO created a new assistant secretary general for intelligence because of his critique. “There’s no connection to any national election campaign,” NATO said, noting that the post had been under consideration several years before Trump began saying the organization was obsolete. NATO first committed to increased counterterrorism activities at a summit in Wales in 2012.\\n“Unlike Hillary Clinton, who has risked so many lives with her careless handling of sensitive information, my administration will not telegraph exactly military plans and what they are.”\\nTellingly, Trump’s prepared text offered no footnote for this claim. There is little evidence that Clinton disclosed military plans through use of a private email server for State Department communications.\\nThere indeed was sensitive information in Clinton’s emails, as the FBI found in its investigation into her use of her private server. Some of the emails were in reference to specific drone strikes being planned, the Wall Street Journal reported. But Trump exaggerates to say they “telegraph exactly military plans and what they are.”\\nAdvertisement\\nRather, these were vaguely worded emails forwarded by Clinton’s aides to her private email account. The Journal reported that the emails “were written within the often-narrow time frame in which State Department officials had to decide whether or not to object to drone strikes before the CIA pulled the trigger, officials said. Law-enforcement and intelligence officials said State Department deliberations about the covert CIA drone program should have been conducted over a more secure government computer system designed to handle classified information.”\\n“We admit about 100,000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East every year.”\\nTrump overstates the figure here. The number of people seeking lawful permanent resident status (“a green card”) adds up to about 76,000 people if you include the Arab countries in the Levant, Persian Gulf and North Africa, according to 2014 Department of Homeland Security figures.\\nYou get to around 100,000 only by including Afghanistan and Pakistan, which of course are outside the traditional “Middle East.” Other Muslim countries, such as Indonesia (2,139) and Somalia (5,190), do not significantly add to the total.\\nAdvertisement\\n“The United States subcommittee on Immigration estimates that Hillary Clinton’s plan would mean roughly 620,000 refugees from all current refugee-sending nations in her first term, assuming no cuts to other refugee programs.”\\nThis figure stems from the unverified assumption that Clinton, who has called for 55,000 additional refugees from Syria, would continue at that pace for every year of her first term, on top of the Obama administration’s proposal for 100,000 refugees for fiscal year 2017. The committee then multiples 155,000 times four years to reach 620,000 refugees. Clinton has never proposed such a “plan,” so this is an invented figure. Clinton only has proposed an increase of 55,000 refugees for one year.\\n“A neighbor saw suspicious behavior. Bombs on the floor and other things, but didn’t warn authorities because they said they didn’t want to be accused of racial profiling.”\\nThere is no evidence this was the case. There have been unconfirmed second- or third-hand reports — a friend of a friend of a neighbor — that a neighbor claimed to have noticed suspicious activity but did not report anything for fear of doing racial profiling. The religion of this supposed neighbor is unknown, but presumably a fear of racial profiling would suggest the neighbor was not Muslim.\\nTrump ad-libbed the phrase about “bombs on the floor.” Even the secondhand reports don’t suggest a neighbor saw “bombs on the floor” — just that they received numerous packages at their home and were in their garage late at night.\\nWhat Donald Trump is doing on the campaign trail Share Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Share on LinkedIn MailSolid Email this link View Photos View Photos Next Image MANCHESTER, NH - NOVEMBER 7: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign event at SNHU Arena in Manchester, NH on Monday November 07, 2016.

KEEP AMERICA GREAT!\"\\nBut Barr\\'s letter and his summary of the Mueller probe is really just the beginning, with lawmakers already pushing for the complete release of the investigation and underlying evidence.\\nHere\\'s what we know, what we don\\'t know, and what we might never find out:\\nMueller report: Special counsel Robert Mueller delivers report marking end of investigation into Trump\\'s campaign, Russia\\nMueller report: Read Attorney General Barr\\'s letter to Congress announcing end of Mueller\\'s Russia probe\\nOpinion: Mueller completes his report. Now let\\'s see it.\\nDid Mueller find collusion?\\nNope, according to the attorney general.\\n\"The Special Counsel\\'s investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election,\" Barr wrote in a letter to Congress summarizing Mueller\\'s investigation.\\nBarr noted that this came \"despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.\"\\nThis was seen as a win for the president, who for years has railed against the investigation and repeatedly said there was no collusion with Russia.\\n\"It was just announced that there was no collusion with Russia, the most ridiculous thing I\\'ve ever heard. There was no collusion, folk,\" Trump said as he boarded Air Force One on the way back to Washington.\\nDid the president obstruct justice?\\nThat isn\\'t really clear.\\nAfter years investigating, Mueller didn\\'t say yes or no. Instead, he offered the evidence he had to Barr.\\nMueller \"did not grat a conclusion — one way or the other — as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction,\" Barr notes in his letter to Congress. He noted Mueller\\'s office laid out evidence \"on both sides\" of the question as to whether Trump committed a crime.\\n\"The Special Counsel states that \\'while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,\\'\" Barr wrote, quoting from Mueller\\'s investigation.\\nBarr said after examining the investigation, departmental policies and talking with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he decided there was not enough proof that Trump committed a crime.\\n\"I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel\\'s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,\" Barr wrote.\\nWhat happens Next?\\nThis letter tees up a massive push to have the entirety of the report released to the public.\\nDemocrats have been very vocal in pushing for everything, including the underlying evidence, to be released. After Barr\\'s letter, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said he would be calling Barr to testify before the committee in coming days.\\nBarr\\'s letter was just a written summary of Mueller\\'s findings – essentially parts of the report that Barr believes he can share in accordance with Justice Department rules. The only information Barr is required to reveal is whether Mueller\\'s bosses overruled his investigative actions. And Barr said that did not happen.\\nHow big is the report?\\nWe don\\'t know. The Justice Department said it was \"comprehensive,\" but didn\\'t elaborate. A security officer from Mueller\\'s office delivered a printed copy to the offices of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who turned it over to Barr on Friday afternoon.\\nWill we get to read the Mueller report?\\nIt\\'s too soon to tell.\\nWhat\\'s certain is that there will be a fight in Congress to make the report public. Lawmakers and Trump have indicated that they want the report to become public. But it\\'s unclear if that will stand after the nation found out Mueller could not determine whether the president committed a crime.\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a conference call with Democrats on Saturday that she would reject any classified briefings of congressional intelligence leaders, known as the \"Gang of Eight.\" Any briefings, she said, should be unclassified so the American public can be informed, according to an official who was on the call.\\nBarr told lawmakers that he was \"committed to as much transparency as possible.\" But he did not say he would release Mueller\\'s complete report. Instead, he said he would consult with Mueller and Rosenstein to \"determine what other information from the report can be released consistent with the law ... and the Department\\'s long-standing practices and policies.\"\\nBarr has said that the department often cannot reveal information about grand juries, or \"derogatory\" information about people who have not been charged with a crime.\\nWhat happens to Mueller?\\nPeter Carr, Mueller\\'s spokesman, said the special counsel would be \"concluding his service in the coming days.\" A small staff would remain to close down Mueller\\'s office. The office had already confirmed that some of his prosecutors and investigators were leaving for other jobs.\\nSo Mueller came up empty?\\nThe investigation has led to charges against some of Trump\\'s closest advisers.\\nAnd we know what investigators believe the 13 Russian nationals and a Russian troll farm did to disrupt U.S. politics and tilt the presidential election in Trump\\'s favor.\\nIt\\'s still unclear whether Mueller\\'s report will speak to a pattern among those cases. \"That\\'s part of what the Mueller report is for. One of the things the Mueller report will do is it will attempt to put all of the indictments Mueller has brought into an overall context,\" said Patrick Cotter, a white-collar defense attorney and a former federal prosecutor.\\nWhat did we know already?\\nIn hundreds of pages of court filings, Mueller\\'s office revealed an extensive Russian intelligence operation that used hacking, stolen documents and phony social media campaigns to sow discord in U.S. politics and support Trump\\'s campaign for the presidency. It revealed that some of Trump\\'s aides worked eagerly to benefit from that operation, seeking damaging information from Russians even as Trump was seeking out business in the country. And it revealed that many of Trump\\'s aides then lied to Congress, federal investigators and the public to downplay those connections.\\nWhat about other people?\\nTrump\\'s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, for example. They, along with Manafort, met on June 9, 2016 at Trump Tower with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya and several other Russians. The meeting occurred after Trump Jr. was promised it would yield dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. That meeting was a focal point of Mueller\\'s investigation, but the fact that no one has faced charges for it suggests Mueller\\'s team didn\\'t think it amounted to a crime.\\nAll the lies?\\nThe special counsel\\'s investigation revealed an extensive pattern of perjury. Several of Trump\\'s former advisers, including Flynn, Cohen and Stone, either admitted to or were accused of lying. Will Mueller address that in his report? Cotter hopes so.\\n\"Because to a federal prosecutor, I think that it is a strikingly unusual aspect on this whole case. That so many people lied to investigators,\" Cotter said.\\nIs this the end?\\nNo.\\nMueller referred his investigation on Cohen\\'s criminal activities to federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, who opened an inquiry into illegal hush-money payments to silence two women who claimed to have had sex with Trump.

Over and over, his lawsuits have failed in court — particularly when the target has been election results or media companies. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Last month, a federal judge roundly rejected another of the former president’s lawsuits — this one against Hillary Clinton — labeling it “a two-hundred-page political manifesto” rather than a serious claim. The judge also cited the “audacity of Plaintiff’s legal theories and the manner in which they clearly contravene binding case law.”\\nSo how does Trump respond to that? Naturally, by filing another audacious, transparently political lawsuit that also seeks to disregard binding case law.\\nTrump’s latest lawsuit targets CNN, which he wants to pay him $475 million for invoking Adolf Hitler in its coverage of him. And perhaps even more than its predecessors, this one should be understood for exactly what it is: a personal grievance in search of an actual legal strategy. (In 2020, Trump’s campaign also sued The Washington Post over opinion columns alleging that the campaign was connected to Russian electoral interference; that case is pending. A similar suit against the New York Times was dismissed last year.)\\nAdvertisement\\nThe lawsuit is riddled with factual errors and non sequiturs. The argument, effectively, is that CNN invoking Hitler while talking about Trump — including calling his quest to overturn the 2020 election based on voter-fraud falsehoods the “big lie” — automatically defames him.\\nBut to prove that claim, the lawsuit leans heavily on random Twitter users who responded to CNN’s work by making a much more direct comparison between Trump and Hitler than the network itself had.\\nTrump’s legal team contends that CNN must have known citing the “big lie” would infringe on Trump’s rights because the network’s new head Chris Licht reportedly said he didn’t like the phrase. But the report they cite (from Fox News) merely states Licht didn’t like the phrase because it was imprecise and reflected language used by Democrats, rather than because he worried about legal action. The lawsuit also claims CNN anchors “were explicitly instructed” by Licht not to use the phrase,” but the Fox report says the opposite — that Licht “did not issue a mandate or formal guidance to stop using the term.”\\nAdvertisement\\nAt another point, when the lawsuit alleges CNN has been spreading propaganda, it cites as proof that “an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll from 2019 found that 99 percent of CNN viewers believed that the Plaintiff lied about the Russia investigation.” But the poll didn’t ask about Trump lying; rather, it asked about whether he had not been “honest and truthful” about it. And the Mueller Report found that Trump had indeed not been honest and truthful.\\nThe lawsuit also cites CNN merely reporting on Democrats who compared Trump to Hitler, saying such coverage “is nothing more than self-serving pronouncements by political opponents of the Plaintiff and their news proxy (and political participant), CNN.” If reporting on such claims is defamation, Fox News might want to watch out.\\nBut even beyond the odd and sometimes false presentation of the details, the lawsuit advances a remarkably thin and novel legal theory that just begs a judge to dispatch it.\\nAdvertisement\\nFirst, it argues that CNN’s reporting meets the legal standard of “actual malice” set forth in the 1964 Supreme Court case New York Times v. Sullivan. That precedent requires plaintiffs to prove the statements made by the media were not only false and defamatory, but that they were made either with the knowledge that they were false or with “reckless disregard for the truth.”\\nBut just as quickly, it argues that that standard shouldn’t apply.\\nIn a footnote, it says that “that standard does not — and should not — apply where the media defendant is not publishing statements to foster debate, critical thinking, or the ‘unfettered interchange of ideas’ but rather seeks to participate in the political arena by offering propaganda.”\\nThe argument is apparently that CNN is not acting as a media organization, so it should not benefit from the higher standard for legal damages in New York Times v. Sullivan. That would be a startling conclusion for a judge to make, no matter what you think about CNN.\\nAdvertisement\\nWith that out of the way, Trump’s lawyers proceed to argue that any comparison between a public official or political candidate and Hitler is “defamation per se” — that is, that such comparisons are so damaging that they must be considered defamatory on their face.\\n“Being likened to Hitler is historically defamation per se as such a comparison tends to subject the target — and has subjected the Plaintiff — to hatred, contempt, distrust, ridicule, and even fear; the comparison has had an adverse impact on the Plaintiff’s reputation and political career,” it says. It adds: “When a public official, or political candidate, is likened to Hitler, it is defamation per se as the statement imputes a characteristic or condition incompatible with the proper exercise of that public office.”\\nAdvertisement\\nAs some noted when the lawsuit was filed, this would effectively open up anyone who has ever compared a politician to Hitler to being sued. What’s more, that legal argument doesn’t address the truthfulness of the statement. What if the comparison was between an actual neo-Nazi and Hitler, for example?\\nThe lawsuit ultimately does get around to citing actual court decisions in making its case. It argues that “the Hitler characterization is one that courts across jurisdictions have historically considered defamation per se.”\\nThe evidence cited for this is bad.\\nIn a footnote, Trump’s legal team cites State v. Guinn, O’Donnell v. Philadelphia Record Co. and Goodrich v. Reporter Pub. Co. If you haven’t heard of these cases, it’s because they are not federal ones. They also all predate 1964′s New York Times v. Sullivan, meaning the “actual malice” standard couldn’t have been applied because it didn’t yet exist.\\nAdvertisement\\nWhat’s more, even these cases don’t seem to apply to the case at hand. As Akiva Cohen noted, the last one dealt with a Texas newspaper which falsely stated that a local draft board had declared the plaintiff to be “pro-Nazi.” The second one dealt with a Philadelphia newspaper which stated that the plaintiff “has broadcast his sympathy with most of Hitler’s aims — such as … liquidation of Jews.”\\nIn other words, these cases turned on factual claims rather than just opinions or comparisons. Trump’s legal team, though, would like to argue that any likening of Trump and what Hitler did is illegal, even if it’s obviously offered as an opinion and even if the comparison isn’t as direct as it was in these cases.\\nOh, and Trump’s legal team would like the courts to ignore Supreme Court precedent to find in their favor.\\nGiftOutline Gift Article'], 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/13/why-secretary-state-rex-tillerson-fired-now-and-what-analysis-why-now-and-what-means-going-ahead-kor/417732002/': ['usatoday.com', \"Tillerson's firing ends his out-of-step time with Trump at State\", 'Gregory Korte', datetime.datetime(2018, 3, 13, 14, 15, 57), 'Why Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was fired now and what it means for North Korea talks\\nShow Caption Hide Caption Rex Tillerson ousted by Trump via Twitter Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was fired on Twitter by President Trump after a 14-month tenure.

I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.”\\nCrowdstrike is the company supposedly tied to the 2016 hacking.\\nZelensky is friendly throughout, promising cooperation, and was the first to bring up Rudy Giuliani.\\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\\nThen Trump played the Biden card and referenced the former vice president pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who had what was apparently an inactive case against the Ukrainian gas giant that was paying Hunter Biden big bucks.\\n“I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair…Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the attorney general. Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great…\\n“There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.”\\nSo in just one week, we have confirmation that Trump did ask Zelensky to investigate his political rival, which would obviously help the president’s reelection prospects.\\nBut was there pressure? A quid pro quo? Trump did not specifically bring up military aid, but then, he didn’t have to. Zelensky was acutely aware that the White House—the president did it personally—had held up $391 million in appropriated payments to his country.\\n“All they’re talking about is nonsense,” Trump said at the U.N. yesterday, adding: “It’s all fake stuff the media makes up with the Democrats, their partners, they’re one and the same, they’re partners.”\\nAnd Zelensky, at a televised meeting, said he never felt pressured by Trump.\\nAs the pundits parse the call, this is ultimately not a legal question. High crimes and misdemeanors is whatever a majority of the House says it is.\\nPelosi may come to regret unleashing these forces, since polls show that impeachment remains unpopular with a majority of the country.\"], 'https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-to-sue-facebook-twitter-google-over-alleged-censorship': ['foxcom', \"Trump to sue Facebook, Twitter, Google over alleged censorship, says they've 'ceased to be private'\", 'Tyler Olson', datetime.datetime(2021, 7, 7, 10, 48, 27), 'Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced that he will lead a lawsuit over alleged censorship against Twitter, Facebook and Google – three tech companies that removed him from their platforms after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters.\\nThe lawsuit will be a class-action, with Trump as the lead plaintiff, claiming that he\\'s been censored by the companies.

I sincerely believe he could beat her in the general election.\\nAdvertisement\\nBernie Sanders, on the other hand, would give Donald Trump fits in a head-to-head match up. Let me break it down.\\n1. Like Donald's other fallen foes, Hillary Clinton represents the political establishment.\\nThis narrative is strong and served as the primary crutch of Donald's strategy to defeat an enormous, well-funded Republican field. Americans are incredibly frustrated with our government and Donald used this very real sentiment to position himself as the anti-establishment candidate. Call it nonsensical, but this position, which Donald will hold against Hillary, is what President Obama used to defeat her in 2008, is what George W. Bush used to defeat Al Gore in 2000, and was even what Bill Clinton used to defeat George H.W. Bush in 1992.\\nHillary Clinton is as establishment as establishment gets. The machine is behind her. Her campaign against Bernie Sanders has only advanced this sentiment.\\nPresumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks to supporters and the media at Trump Tower following his victory in the Indiana primary on Tuesday.

Hillary's millions of dollars worth of paid speeches to banks, lobbyists and billionaires cede a certain moral high ground to Donald Trump.\\nDonald Trump is a filthy rich fat cat. He's gaudy and cartoonish with his wealth. He openly admits that he hires foreign workers for cheap jobs and abuses tax loopholes. He is the poster child for everything that Bernie Sanders has railed against — not just in this campaign, but for his entire life in public service.\\nHillary Clinton will not really be able to say much about this, though, because Donald's biggest liability is also an enormous liability for her. What's worse, being Scrooge McDuck, or getting paid to speak to a room full of Scrooge McDucks over and over and over again and refusing to release the transcripts of what you said to them? She and Bill rented a home in the Hamptons for $50,000 per week. They've made $230 million since Bill left office. Hillary made more money in 12 speeches to big banks than most American's will make in their lifetime.\\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks during a campaign stop in Charleston, W. Va., Tuesday. (Paul Sancya/AP)\\nBernie Sanders is a career public servant and will be so until the day he dies. His entire life stands in stark contrast to the outrageous opulence of both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The thought that this angle will basically be off the table if the campaign is between Donald and Hillary is simply dumb.\\n3. Independent and new voters are flocking to Bernie Sanders and even to Donald Trump, but not to Hillary Clinton.\\nBernie Sanders is the longest standing Independent in the history of the United States Congress. Consequently, independent voters have flocked to his campaign en masse. When they are allowed to vote in primaries, like they did on Tuesday in Indiana, he wins. They have been absolutely essential to his wins in 18 different states thus far. With only 29% of Americans identifying as Democrats and 26% as Republicans, the largest voting bloc is independents.\\nAdvertisement\\nThose voters make-up a large spectrum of political views and demographics, but they are all united in their frustrations with the government, the status quo and lobbyists.\\nI believe many independent voters will stay at home if Bernie Sanders isn't a candidate. It will be up to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party to win them over, but they've expressed very little interest in such a thing thus far. Many more conservative independents will indeed vote for Trump.\\nExpand Autoplay Image 1 of 18 Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, donated $1.25 million in support of Donald Trump. Thiel, the only member of the tech community to support the Republican candidate, is now high on a very short list of big Trump contributors. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\\n4. Hillary's reliance on millions of dollars from Super PACs is a real problem.\\nZero percent of Bernie's campaign funds come from Super PACs. Four percent of Donald's campaign funds come from Super PACs.\\nHillary? More than seven times that amount. An astounding 30% of her campaign funds come from Super PACs. Donald Trump could feasibly decide he isn't taking a dime from them and put Hillary in a position to defend her reliance on them.\\nThis would never be an issue for Bernie Sanders. It is his rejection of Super PAC money that has actually won over millions of his voters. For them, this issue is everything. The idea of supporting the candidate who relies so heavily on this type of money nauseates many. Donald Trump will be able to get on the mic and tell supporters that he just isn't influenced by outside money and they'll believe him.\\nAdvertisement\\n5. Young voters are crazy about Bernie Sanders and just don't care for Hillary Clinton.\\nRepublican presidential candidate, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is the latest GOP rival to be defeated by Donald Trump. (Darron Cummings/AP)\\nBy young, we don't just mean teenagers. Voters under 25, voters under 35, even voters under 45 all support Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton. The younger the voter, the bigger the margin. In some age groups he's beating her by 85%-15%.\\nThese young voters were the lifeblood and energy of Barack Obama's campaign and they have virtually rejected Clinton altogether in this campaign. They are incredibly loyal to Bernie. They trust him and believe in him. They won't simply or easily transfer over to another campaign. This is a real problem for Clinton and will show immediately in a general election.\\nHating Trump is not the same thing as supporting Hillary Clinton and young voters know this. While Donald Trump doesn't have a youth movement of any kind to talk about, it just matters a heck of a lot less if it's Clinton he's going against.\\nBernie has consistently said that he does better in every poll in a head to head match up against Donald Trump than Hillary does. The non-partisan fact-checkers at Politifact found this claim to be accurate.\\nIn one new poll, Trump actually leads by 2 points in a race against Hillary. In another, she's just up by 3 points against Trump. Bernie beats Trump in every poll and by larger margins.\\nAdvertisement\\nThis race isn't new anymore. People know enough about Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to make an informed decision. I believe these polls are accurate. The team at FiveThirtyEight stated that they believe the polls between Trump and Clinton will continue to narrow.\\nWe can all agree that Trump must be stopped, but this much is clear - Hillary Clinton is not the best opponent to stop him.\"], 'https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/democrats-use-video-trump-s-words-to-build-impeachment-case': ['bloomberg.com', 'Are you a robot?', '', datetime.datetime(2021, 2, 11, 0, 0), 'Why did this happen?\\nPlease make sure your browser supports JavaScript and cookies and that you are not blocking them from loading.

But Cohen told Stephanopoulos that he had no desire to humiliate Trump, and that Mueller has a “substantial amount of information” to corroborate his assertions about the hush agreements and the Russia dealings.\\nIn the face of such evidence, Trump’s legal team has gradually shifted its defense.

The purge also removed followers from the accounts of many other famous people. Trump lost approximately 300,000 followers, far fewer than Barack Obama (more than 2 million) and the Dalai Lama (about 375,000), according to a New York Times count.\\nWhen Trump began accusing Twitter last year of malicious behavior over the purge, Twitter issued a statement saying “many prominent accounts have seen follower counts drop.” It explained that it had removed “fake accounts and those engaging in malicious behavior” to improve the health of the service.\\nWomen’s unemployment\\nTrump touted the low unemployment rate for women, saying: “Women, I think, Kellyanne (Conway), the best in 75 years – the best unemployment numbers in 75 years.”\\nFacts First: Trump exaggerated slightly. The women’s unemployment rate for June is 3.6%, a tick above the 3.4% in April and 3.5% in May. Those are excellent numbers, but it has been 66 years since the women’s rate has been this low, not 75. Prior to Trump’s presidency, the last time the rate fell to 3.6% was October 1953.\\nCensus\\nWhile arguing that he should be permitted to include a citizenship question in the 2020 US census, Trump said that the census survey can ask people about the number of beds and toilets they have but not about whether they are citizens.\\n“They go through houses, they go up, they ring doorbells, they talk to people. How many toilets do they have? How many desks do they have? How many beds? What’s their roof made of?” Trump said. “The only thing we can’t ask is ‘Are you a citizen of the United States?’”\\nFacts First: Trump is wrongly suggesting that the decennial census asks households about the number of toilets in a house. He could be referring to supplemental surveys from the Census Bureau, which do ask questions about living conditions of a small sample of households. If that’s the case, then he’s still wrong, since these surveys do ask questions of citizenship.\\nThe decennial census – which counts the US population every ten years and is required by the Constitution – was last administered in 2010. That census did not include questions on plumbing, bedrooms, and desks. Instead, the decennial census focuses on questions like age and race and number of occupants in a household.\\nTrump could be referring to other surveys sent out from the Census Bureau such as the American Community Survey, which is sent to just a fraction of households, about 3.54 million addresses every year.\\nOne of the main functions of the ACS, according the Census Bureau, is to gather “data that help determine how more than $675 billion in federal and state funds are distributed each year.” The 2019 version of this survey includes questions on the education levels and employment status of those living on the property, as well as the property’s computer access, number of rooms, if there is access to hot and cold water and much more.\\nBut the ACS also includes questions on citizenship. “Is this person a citizen of the United States?” this year’s version asks. So, Trump is wrong to suggest that while you can ask these more specific questions on living conditions you cannot ask a citizenship status question.\\nOn the specifics, Trump’s argument lacks facts, and on his larger point he’s flatly wrong: the decennial census did not ask about number of bathrooms, bedrooms, and so on.\\n401(k)s\\nTrump touted a new record set by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, then made a claim about how much 401(k) retirement plans have increased.\\n“I don’t know if you know but we just hit 27,000 on the Dow. …The highest in history, for those of you that like the stock market, but the stock market means jobs. I view it as jobs, and I view it as 401(k)s. … And people with 401(k)s, they’re up 72% and 67%, and the wife or the husband, whoever’s responsible, the other one says ‘you’re a genius, you’re a great financial investor, darling you’re up 77% this year.’”\\nFacts First: These percentages overstate gains in US stock markets.\\nIt is possible that some people have 401(k)s that are up 77% on the year or since Trump was elected, but stock markets themselves are not up that much. At the close of trading on the day Trump spoke, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up by 16%, the S&P 500 Index by 20%, the Nasdaq by 24%.\\nThe gains are greater if you go back to Trump’s election day, as the President often does: 48% for the Dow, 40% for the S&P, 58% for the Nasdaq. Still, none of them approaches 77%.\\nCrowds, part 1\\nTrump claimed that there were thousands of people outside his June campaign kickoff rally in Orlando in addition to the large crowd inside.\\n“We had sort of an opening rally in Orlando, Florida. We had 109,000, maybe more, wanting to come. We were doing as much as we could to keep people not from coming. We had a 21,000-seat stadium, and then with the basketball court, it held many more than that, it was packed. And we had a similar number outside.”\\nFacts First: There were nowhere close to 21,000 people outside the rally as Trump was speaking. And the arena had a capacity of 20,000 that night, not “many more than” 21,000.\\nThe Orlando Sentinel, which debunked a previous version of Trump’s claim about the crowd “outside,” reported that the overflow area outside the Amway Center was “virtually empty” as Trump spoke, with only “a few dozen people in the holding area.” The paper reported: “About an hour before the President’s speech, the long lines around the Amway were gone and people could easily walk into the event right up to the start of the rally.”\\nThe city of Orlando, which owns the arena, issued an official crowd count of 19,792, just shy of the 20,000 a city spokesperson said would have been let in, the Sentinel reported.\\nTrump has previously claimed, also falsely, that tens of thousands of people were stuck outside various other campaign events, many of which have been debunked previously.\\nTrump then took a shot at the number of people in the audience when Joe Biden announced his candidacy earlier this year.\\nCrowds, part 2\\n“You look at Biden. They say he had 600 people. That wasn’t 600, that was 150 people. That was 150.”\\nFacts First: Independent observers reported that Joe Biden did indeed have 600 people at his first public event after announcing his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination.\\nThe Atlantic said that journalists occupied 100 of the 600 spots at a union hall in Pittsburgh, but that is still 500 non-journalists, not 150.\\nDemocrats and the border wall\\nTrump accused the Democrats of hypocrisy for their opposition to his proposed border wall.\\n“For instance, on the wall: Chuck Schumer was totally in favor of a wall, right Liz (Cheney)? Totally in favor. Everybody: Hillary, everybody. They were all in favor of a wall just a few years ago.”\\nFacts First: Some Democrats, not all, voted in 2006 to approve a fence that Trump himself said was much different than the wall he wanted.\\nIt is not true that “everybody” in the Democratic Party supported even this fencing. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi voted against. In the Senate, 26 Democrats (including Schumer and Clinton) voted yes, 17 voted no.\\nThe law, called the Secure Fence Act, was to authorize 700 miles of fencing on the Mexican border. Trump himself said during the 2016 campaign that this fencing was not comparable to the giant concrete wall he was proposing: “It was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall,” he told Fox News.\\nThis story has been updated.'], 'https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/how-far-will-trump-go-hide-jan-6-documents-congress-n1283713': ['msnbc.com', 'How far will Trump go to hide Jan. 6 documents from Congress?', \"Https, Media-Cldnry.S-Nbcnews.Com Image Upload Newscms, Steve Benen, Steve Benen Is A Producer For, The Rachel Maddow Show, The Editor Of Maddowblog, An Msnbc Political Contributor.

Chutkan wrote. \"But Presidents are not kings, and Plaintiff is not President.\"\\nThat decision cleared the way for the National Archives, which houses presidential records, to release the relevant materials to the bipartisan committee this week. Yesterday, the Republican and his lawyers asked the same judge for an emergency injunction, blocking enforcement of her ruling while the matter is appealed. As NBC News reported overnight, she declined.\\nU.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan denied a request for an emergency injunction filed by Trump\\'s lawyers a day after she ruled against Trump, who was trying to stop a House committee from receiving scores of White House documents from the Trump administration pertaining to the Capitol riot. Trump has argued that the files are protected by executive privilege.\\n\"This court will not effectively ignore its own reasoning in denying injunctive relief in the first place to grant injunctive relief now,\" Chutkan wrote.\\nFor those who may need a refresher about how we arrived at this point, it was several weeks ago when the bipartisan House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack requested extensive materials from the White House, prompting Trump to demand absolute secrecy.\\nAs NBC News recently noted, as a matter of tradition, sitting presidents have shielded White House materials at the request of their predecessors. But not this time: President Joe Biden and his team concluded that there are \"unique and extraordinary circumstances\" surrounding the insurrectionist attack on the Capitol.\\nTrump and his team sued both the committee and the National Archives, which houses presidential records. This week, at least at the district court level, that lawsuit failed, clearing the way for lawmakers to access everything from call logs to handwritten notes, internal emails to draft presidential memoranda.\\nSo what happens now? In theory, the former president could simply accept the ruling and allow the bipartisan investigation to continue. In practice, Trump and his team have already indicated they\\'ll take the matter to an appellate court and make another plea for an emergency injunction, which would block the National Archives from cooperating with Congress, while the merits of the case are litigated further.\\nIf the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals declines, it\\'s a safe bet the Republican will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene.\\nIn all likelihood, the former president will eventually lose this fight. As Tuesday\\'s ruling explained, \"At bottom, this is a dispute between a former and incumbent President. And the Supreme Court has already made clear that in such circumstances, the incumbent\\'s view is accorded greater weight.\"\\nTrump and his attorneys very likely know this. They\\'re nevertheless hoping to drag the process out as long as possible — trying to run out the clock is a go-to move for the former president — in the hopes of catching a break. The more the court fight is extended, the more likely it becomes that Trump can keep the documents secret until his party has a chance to reclaim the U.S. House majority and shut down the investigation.\\nBut while the process unfolds, the political realizations are plain: Trump appears about as desperate to hide these Jan. 6 materials as he is to hide his tax returns.'], 'https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/25/how-to-trade-impeachment.html': ['cnbc.com', 'How investors are responding to the Trump impeachment inquiry', 'Patti Domm, In', datetime.datetime(2019, 9, 25, 19, 9, 43), 'President Donald Trump attends a presentation ceremony of the Medal of Valor and heroic commendations to civilians and police officers who responded to mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio and El Paso, Texas during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House in Washington, September 9, 2019.\\nThe idea of impeachment was initially a negative for stocks, which sold off Tuesday as investors anticipated Pelosi\\'s 5 p.m. announcement. Stocks were mixed in early trading Wednesday but came off lows when a memo of Trump\\'s conversation with Ukraine\\'s president did not show that Trump threatened to withhold aid from Ukraine.\\nOn Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would investigate impeaching Trump for seeking help from the president of the Ukraine in gathering dirt on Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden and his son.\\nStocks so far are shrugging off risks that President Donald Trump could be impeached, but investors may be betting that if he is, the market will ultimately rally, the way it did in the Clinton era.\\nSemiconductors, which have been tied to China trade, moved higher, and the SMH VanEck Vecotrs Semiconductor ETF was up about 1.1%.

I really don\\'t think investors will take the risk of impeachment seriously at this point. If there\\'s really strong damning evidence, that\\'s a different matter.\"\\nThe House could impeach Trump, as it did Clinton, but it is unlikely the Senate will go along with it.\\nStrategas policy analysts Dan Clifton said on the trade front, the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada will probably now be at even more risk, since Democrats are unlikely to agree to it. But there could be a swifter movement on China, and Trump now is more likely to accept a smaller deal, putting aside some of the thornier issues. That would be good for industrial stocks, semiconductors and those assets impacted by a positive trade outcome, like energy and other commodities.\\n\"The president\\'s approval rating has been tied to better news on China trade over the last year and a half,\" said Clifton, adding it would improve confidence if Trump were to solve some trade conflicts with China. \"He needs to govern and start showing accomplishments. China is the best way for him to do that,\" he said.\\nStrategists have been pointing to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton as being most similar to current events, if the House does impeach Trump. Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives but immediately acquitted by the Senate in February, 1999. The S&P 500 rallied 28% from January, 1998, as the the first reports of Clinton\\'s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky emerged, through the Senate acquittal, according to Bespoke.\\nSource: Bespoke\\n\"Sure, there was a decline of 20% at one point in between, but that was due to the Russia Crisis and the collapse of Long-Term Capital rather than anything to do with what was going on in the White House,\" notes Bespoke co-founder Paul Hickey.\\nThat contrasts with a weak market when President Richard Nixon was being investigated for Watergate, but he resigned before Congress could impeach him. LPL Financial found that the S&P was 39.2% higher a year after the impeachment process began against Clinton, and was down 33.4% a year after proceedings were started again Nixon.\\nSource: LPL Financial\\nHickey said an important distinction was that the economy was in far worse shape when Nixon was in the White House during the early 1970s.\\nIn the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield moved lower Tuesday and Wednesday, then higher and was at 1.70%, just 2 basis points below Monday\\'s level.\\n\"We look for markets to continue undergoing a mild risk-off episode as investors and traders digest the news that the impeachment investigation is under way. The 10yr Treasury has rallied very slightly – call it 1-2bps -- since late Sep. 24, when the possibility of impeachment gathered steam,\" noted Michael Schumacher, Wells Fargo, director, rates strategy.\\n\"We guesstimate the \\'impeachment effect\\' is good for another 5-10bps rally in 10s could happen.\"\\nBut if Trump is cleared in an acquittal, the move could more than reverse.\\n\"The 10-year Treasury yield rose about 50bps in less than two months from the date Mr. Clinton was impeached to the day the Senate acquitted him.

Morgan strategists said, in a note, that they would not change their overall investment recommendations, which are moderately cyclical, due to prior geopolitical and political impacts on business and profits.\\nThey are overweight stocks versus fixed income, and overweight U.S. equities versus non-U.S. stocks. They are overweight a couple of cyclical sectors—technology and discretionary. They are also overweight part of the emerging markets complex, and are long hedges against recession and geopolitics, including Japanese yen, gold and some energy assets.\\nThe J.P.

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight After 11 hours of fierce argument on the House floor between Democrats and Republicans over Trump’s conduct with Ukraine, lawmakers voted almost entirely along party lines to impeach him. Trump becomes the third president in U.S. history to face trial in the Senate — a proceeding that will determine whether he is removed from office less than one year before he stands for reelection.\\nOn Trump’s 1,062nd day in office, Congress brought a momentous reckoning to an un\\xador\\xadtho\\xaddox president who has tested America’s institutions with an array of unrestrained actions, including some that a collection of his own appointees and other government witnesses testified were reckless and endangered national security.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe Democratic-controlled House passed two articles of impeachment against Trump — abuse of power and obstruction of Congress — related to the president’s attempts to withhold military aid to Ukraine and pressure its government to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a potential 2020 Democratic opponent.\\nAfter hours of debate on Dec. 18, the House of Representatives passed two articles of impeachment against President Trump. (Video: The Washington Post)\\nThe House voted 230 to 197 to approve the article charging abuse of power, with the gavel falling about 8:30 p.m. On the obstruction of Congress vote, which followed soon after, the tally was 229 to 198.\\nAll Republicans voted against both articles. Among Democrats, two voted no on the first article and three on the second, with one — Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) — voting “present” both times.\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) framed the day’s proceedings through the long lens of history, reciting the Pledge of Allegiance and singling out the line “the republic for which it stands.”\\n“Very sadly, now our founders’ vision of a republic is under threat from actions from the White House,” Pelosi said. She added, “If we do not act now, we would be derelict in our duty.”\\nThe Senate is widely expected to acquit Trump, since conviction and removal would require 67 votes in a chamber where Democrats and their allies hold 47 seats. If Trump is acquitted, it would launch an unpredictable stretch of his presidency; his reaction would be uncertain after opponents had taken a powerful but ultimately unsuccessful shot at removing him.\\nAdvertisement\\nAfter Wednesday’s votes, Pelosi left open the possibility of delaying a procedural step that triggers a Senate trial, saying she might not name House impeachment managers and deliver the articles to the Senate unless Republicans there establish a “fair” process. In doing so, Pelosi was effectively attempting to gain leverage over the Senate’s process for weighing the charges against Trump.\\n“So far we have not seen anything that looks fair to us,” Pelosi said.\\nWednesday’s action punctuated a quarter-century of increasingly poisonous partisanship in Washington, one that arguably began during Bill Clinton’s presidency, was extended with rebellions against presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and is culminating in the Trump era.\\nThe intensity and polarization of the debate on the House floor vividly illustrated the extent to which leaders of the two parties now believe entirely different accounts of what occurred and are motivated by different concerns. At times they sounded almost as if they were representing different countries.\\nDemocrats characterized Trump as an immediate threat to the nation he was elected to lead, casting his actions as an unprecedented affront to American values. Republicans denounced those charges as unsubstantiated and the process as illegitimate, repeatedly accusing the Democrats of seeking to illegally overturn the results of the last election.\\nTrump, who has nursed deep feelings of persecution as his impeachment has grown more likely, watched the debate unfold from the White House. Ten minutes after press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement saying the president was “working all day,” Trump vented his fury on Twitter: “SUCH ATROCIOUS LIES BY THE RADICAL LEFT, DO NOTHING DEMOCRATS. THIS IS AN ASSAULT ON AMERICA, AND AN ASSAULT ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY!!!!”\\nAdvertisement\\nJust before the House voted, Trump took the stage in Michigan, where he rallied an estimated 10,000 supporters at a sports arena in Battle Creek — a muscular display of political potency even at the historic low point of his presidency.\\n“This lawless partisan impeachment is a suicide march for the Democratic Party,” Trump told the crowd. He added, “After three years of sinister witch hunts, hoaxes, scams, tonight House Democrats are trying to nullify the ballots of tens of millions of patriotic Americans.”\\nBack in Washington, Pelosi sought to rebut allegations from Republicans that her party has cast about since Trump took office for a reason to impeach him, saying no lawmaker of either party came to the Capitol to remove a president. She said Trump had forced Congress’s hand because he had “violated the Constitution.”\\nAdvertisement\\n“He gave us no choice,” Pelosi said, drawing applause from Democrats by declaring that “we are here to defend democracy for the people.”\\nBarring a drastic shift in momentum, Trump is expected to be acquitted in the Senate, where a two-thirds supermajority is required to remove a president who has been impeached. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said he is planning a short trial and declared himself partial to protecting Trump.\\nNevertheless, Trump’s impeachment by the House will be a defining mark on his legacy. Wednesday’s action cemented on a constitutional level the opposition party’s view that Trump is unfit to serve, elevating the informal resistance to his presidency, which has raged from coast to coast, into the permanent historical record.\\nAfter Democrats surfed an anti-Trump wave in the 2018 midterm elections to seize the House majority, Pelosi reclaimed the speaker’s gavel she had lost eight years before with a clear mandate from her party’s base to serve as a check on the president’s power and investigate his conduct.\\nAdvertisement\\nPelosi at first resisted pressure from the left to impeach Trump, however, arguing that such a move would be unnecessarily divisive. But she formally opened an inquiry in September after a whistleblower reported concerns about Trump’s conduct on a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump explicitly asked Zelensky to investigate Biden.\\nMarathon hearings last month before the House Intelligence Committee produced damaging testimony detailing Trump’s actions and those of his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, among others. That helped solidify the support of even centrist Democrats for moving against the president, and the House Judiciary Committee then drafted the two articles of impeachment.\\nDemocrats said Wednesday that declining to punish a presidential demand that a foreign government influence an American election would be an unacceptable abdication of constitutional responsibility. Such an action clearly meets the standard of “high crimes and misdemeanors” that the Constitution lays out for impeachment, they said.\\nAdvertisement\\n“The evidence is clear that President Trump took advantage of Ukraine’s vulnerability and abused the powers of his office to pressure Ukraine to help his reelection campaign,” said Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). “This is the highest of high crimes, and President Trump must be held to account.”\\nDemocrats and Republicans took turns at the rostrum delivering short, impassioned speeches — a furious debate that in many ways showcased how much Trump has remade the two parties.\\nThe Republicans, mostly white men, stood staunchly behind the president and repeated many of his statements vilifying the opposition. The Democrats, notably more diverse in race and gender, uniformly attacked the president’s conduct as an affront to American values.\\n“When we say we uphold the Constitution, we are not talking about a piece of parchment,” said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. “We’re talking about a beautiful architecture in which ambition is set against ambition, in which no branch of government can dominate another.”\\nAdvertisement\\nHe added, “That is what it means to uphold the Constitution. If you ignore it, if you say the president may refuse to comply, may refuse lawful process, may coerce an ally, may cheat in an election because he’s the president of our party, you do not uphold our Constitution.”\\nRepublicans responded that Democratic leaders had concocted a scheme to oust the president because they were afraid they could not beat him in next November’s election.\\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said, “Democrats have wanted to impeach President Trump since the day he was elected — and nothing was going to get in their way, certainly not the truth.”\\nThough some Republican lawmakers defended Trump on the substance of the allegations, many spent most of their time airing grievances about the process. They often echoed the rambling, six-page letter Trump issued to Pelosi on Tuesday, and they repeated the president’s claims of personal persecution in sometimes overheated terms.\\nAdvertisement\\n“When Jesus was falsely accused of treason, Pontius Pilate gave Jesus the opportunity to face his accusers,” said Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.). “During that sham trial, Pontius Pilate afforded more rights to Jesus than the Democrats have afforded this president in this process.”\\nOther GOP House members described impeachment as the outgrowth of insidious forces.\\n“I have descended into the belly of the beast. I have witnessed a terror within,” said Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.)\\nRep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), meanwhile, drew a parallel to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. After quoting President Franklin D. Roosevelt calling Dec. 7 “a date that will live in infamy,” Kelly said, “Today, December the 18th, 2019, is another date that will live in infamy.”\\nDemocrats captured the House majority last year in part by winning in suburban areas where Trump had prevailed two years earlier. Virtually all the Democrats from such Republican-leaning districts announced they would vote to impeach Trump, risking their seats in the face of aggressive campaigns in their home districts pressuring them to break ranks.\\nThe Democrats’ defectors were Reps. Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey. Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) voted in favor of the abuse of power article but switched to no for obstruction of Congress.\\nWhile no Republicans supported impeachment, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, who left the party earlier this year to become an independent over frustration with the GOP’s fealty to Trump, did so.\\nRepublicans vowed to use the impeachment vote as a political cudgel against Democrats in next year’s elections.\\n“Those who vote yes on today’s articles of impeachment must carry the heavy burden of shame and guilt for as long as they serve in Congress — which won’t be long, because the American people will remember in November,” said Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.).\\nDemocrats, meanwhile, seemed eager to turn the page and refocus on health care and other issues that propelled them to victory in 2018.\\n“No one came to Congress to impeach a president,” said Rep. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), who ran House Democrats’ campaign organization last year. “We came here to solve the mighty issues that impact the lives of the constituents we pledge to serve.”\\nBut, he added, “this moment has found us.”\\nRachael Bade, Aaron Blake, Mike DeBonis and John Wagner contributed to this report.\\nGiftOutline Gift Article'], 'https://www.cnet.com/how-to/amazon-rainforest-fire-how-to-spot-inaccurate-photos-on-social-media/': ['cnet.com', 'Amazon rainforest fires: How to spot inaccurate photos on social media', \"Shelbrown, She Her Hers, Is A Writer For Cnet'S Services, Software Team.

His authentic phoniness.', 'Michael Kinsley, April, Michael Kinsley Is A Columnist For Vanity Fair Magazine, A Contributing Columnist For The Post.', datetime.datetime(2016, 4, 27, 11, 59, 59), 'Michael Kinsley is a columnist for Vanity Fair magazine and a contributing columnist for The Post.\\nThe chances of Donald Trump becoming the Republican nominee for president have gone from impossible to probable, while Hillary Clinton’s chances of being the Democrat have moved from likely to virtually certain. So, barring more surprises, it’s probably going to be Hillary vs. The Donald in the fall.\\nThere is no mystery about Clinton. Those who support her as well as those who oppose her have little trouble explaining why. Trump is another matter. No one I know would even consider voting for Trump. So who are all these millions who support him? Why, they are working-class white men, we are told, who feel betrayed by the failure of both parties to deal with stagnant incomes, growing debts and shrinking possibilities for their retirements and their childrens’ futures.\\nIt’s a plausible theory. And it may help to explain Bernie Sanders. But no one has ever associated Trump with these blue-collar issues. How has he become the tribune of the people in this election? Is he just the one who got there first?\\nThe explanation is not so difficult. In the opening paragraph of his novel “Ravelstein,” Saul Bellow writes, “Anyone who wants to govern the country has to entertain it.” Clinton has been called many things, but “entertaining” is not one of them. This is not the case with Trump, who is an authentic American character like something out of Mark Twain. All the other candidates except Sanders had the character squeezed out of them when they decided they wanted to be president. Trump’s a phony of course (not to mention a racist), but his phoniness is authentic. He’s self-made — not in the financial sense, but characterologically.\\nAnd what a character! You always want to know what he will say or do next. To be sure, it’s not really the president’s job to keep the citizenry entertained, although voting on the basis of entertainment value is not entirely irrational, given that entertainment is the main benefit you’re likely to get from our political system. Anyway, not knowing what he’ll do next does have its charms, and they go beyond entertainment.\\nDuring the nuclear standoff of the 1960s and 1970s, Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger took advantage of a doctrine out of the branch of economics known as game theory, which holds that sometimes it pays to be — or at least to be perceived to be — crazy. No rational person would ever start a nuclear war. So the one who can get the other side to back down in any future nuclear standoff is the one who convinces the world that he or she is more irrational. Vladimir Putin has done a pretty good job here, you have to admit. Imagine Putin and any of the American presidential candidates facing each other across the nuclear divide, each threatening to push the button unless their demands are met. Which of the Americans is crazy enough to actually do it?\\nWhen Barack Obama proposes something, you know it’s been analyzed and balanced and weighed against the alternatives, tested in the laboratory and found to be a reasonable solution given the limitations and under the circumstances. When Trump faces some similar challenge, you don’t know what he’s going to say or do. And if he says he’s going to do something crazy, like get the Mexicans to pay for a wall across their own country to keep themselves out of ours, you can’t be sure he won’t actually try to do it.\\nIt’s clear now that the title of Trump’s book “The Art of the Deal ” actually reflects a philosophy of life: Trump believes that everything in life is a negotiation, a deal, and he believes that making deals uses skills that he has and his rivals lack. This is why he may even have been sincere in his puzzlement about why the media has been so insistent that he reveal his tax returns. Paying taxes, like so much else in life, is a negotiation — at least at Trump’s level. And why would you give your opponent a major document, whether it reveals misbehavior or not? What is misbehavior, for that matter? It’s all up for negotiation.\\nPeople (read: liberals) are afraid of what Trump might do as president. All this silly talk about moving to Canada. But the thing to really worry about in a Trump presidency is what happens a couple of years from now, when people who have invested their hopes in Trump and his magic tricks discover that he is not the Wizard of Oz but rather the man behind the curtain.'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/22/no-filter-my-week-long-quest-to-break-out-of-my-political-bubble': ['theguardian.com', 'No filter: my week-long quest to break out of my political bubble', 'John Harris', datetime.datetime(2019, 10, 22, 5, 1, 7), 'As strange as it may sound, above a Dorothy House charity shop in the shabbier end of central Bath, a handful of people are quietly trying to push the world – or at least a small part of it – away from the polarisation that currently defines politics, and towards something a bit more open and empathic. To compound the unlikeliness of it all, they are led by a man called Jim Morrison: not the reincarnated singer of the Doors, but the 40-year-old founder of a new online platform called OneSub, whose strapline is “Break the echo chamber”.\\nI have come to OneSub’s HQ as part of a week-long quest to push my reading habits and general soaking-up of information out of my usual left-inclined social media bubble, get some much-needed perspective, and try to use the internet as it was originally intended – not to confirm my prejudices, but to reintroduce me to the confounding, complicated, surprising realities of the world as it actually is.\\nBy presenting people with the chance to read news that goes against their political prejudices, OneSub claims to “help you manage your bias”. As I discover by using it, what this means in practice is winningly straightforward. Investigating the mess around the Brexit negotiations brings up a piece from Sky News headlined: “Jacob Rees-Mogg hints at Brexit compromises”, which fits my belief that the reckless Tories trying to take us out of the EU are colliding with reality – but which is followed by an article from the Daily Telegraph titled: “Fury as EU demands more Brexit concessions.”\\nSimilarly, a piece that tells me what a reckless idiot Donald Trump is tends to be followed by something that attempts to be more neutral, and another item written from a supportive perspective – after which I get a message that says: “You have read three different viewpoints of the same story and have a balanced perspective!”\\nOneSub is short for “one subscription”, which encapsulates the eventual aim of charging users for a service that will include news hidden behind some outlets’ paywalls. On the first floor of the company’s HQ, six or so employees are crammed into a compact office, compiling the pieces that are accessible on a website and an app, and overseeing the machine-learning systems that incessantly comb about 15 English-language news outlets and grade articles’ levels of political bias. Upstairs, Morrison sits in an even smaller meeting room, takes delivery of a cup of tea and explains what everyone here is trying to do.\\nMorrison is an internet specialist rather than a political anorak, which partly explains why, to a political journalist such as myself, his take on current affairs seems so unorthodox. He says one of his central fears about modern Britain is that “they’ve managed to privatise the health service and education system without even discussing it”, but he voted Tory at the last election, partly because he thinks Jeremy Corbyn is “quite an extreme leftwinger”. If the election system was fairer, he says he would favour the Lib Dems, but he also voted leave in the 2016 referendum. When I probe him about what he and his colleagues are trying to do, he often meets a question with another question, or leads the conversation towards qualifications and contradictions.\\nBy way of a simple illustration of what OneSub is all about, he draws a bell curve – the stereotypical line indicating that when it comes to politics, most people are still somewhere in the middle. “But if you take any topic, the way that newspapers and politicians speak is that everyone is distributed that way” – he points at the far right and left – “so everyone is either leave or remain, or Labour or Conservative, or Republican or Democrat. And I call bullshit on that, I suppose. I don’t think it’s the case.”\\nHis alternative, he explains, is about encouraging “moderate conversations”, and alerting people to basic facts. “Most issues are not binary, simplistic things,” he insists.\\nThey may not be, but why does he think a small setup such as his can push back against the might of Facebook, Twitter and all the rest, and subvert the logic of polarisation that seems to have gripped billions of people across the planet? “Facebook is addictive – it’s a dopamine addiction, the same as gambling and porn and everything else, right?” he says. “But, you know, oxytocin is a pretty rewarding chemical. That’s the chemical that you get when you do something you’re proud of. And so we’re trying to focus on that. We send you an email at the end of every week that says: ‘Here is what you’ve read. And this week, you read all this stuff that you wouldn’t normally read.’ That’s a reward mechanism too.”\\nMorrison and his team are not the only people trying to offer a viable alternative to online polarisation. In Berlin, a small team has been working for two years on a news aggregator called Nuzzera – taglined “Burst your bubble” – whose German-language model was released on Apple and Google’s app stores this month (an English version is in the pipeline). One of its co-founders is Janine Perkuhn, who tells me Nuzzera was sparked into being not just by Brexit and Donald Trump, but also the rise in Germany of the far-right party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), whose online hyperactivity is jaw-dropping. One recent study found that 85% of all shared posts originating from German political parties came from the AfD.\\nPerkuhn says Nuzzera’s aim is simply to “allow people to be better informed”, and that there are signs of hope that, however popular the big platforms might be, this is what at least some people want. “What we see, and what a lot of studies show, is that a lot of people mistrust social media,” she says. “They often think it’s not even the right place to read news. But a lot of people are used to it, and it’s hard to break patterns. That’s one of the biggest challenges we have.”\\nIn the US, among a handful of initiatives with roughly the same aims, there is AllSides, a news site that – like OneSub – presents different versions of stories rated for bias, and takes its users to such wildly diverse outlets as the New York Times, the far-right website Breitbart and the left-leaning Mother Jones. Founded in 2012, its dedication to flagging up the biases that sit behind the news extends even to its own staff – who, like the articles AllSides aggregates, have ratings for their political leanings: two Ls and two Rs that represent left, “lean left”, right and “lean right”, and a single C that puts them in the political middle.\\nIts founder and chief executive is John Gable, who has a “lean right” rating, and an affinity with the Republican party. Nearly 25 years ago, his internet career began at the trailblazing company Netscape. “Like everybody else, I drank the Kool-Aid back then,” he says. “I completely believed in the possibilities of the internet to connect people. But I was concerned that the internet might also train us to discriminate against each other in new ways. The main thing I saw was that it would encourage us to think in terms of metaphor, or category: ‘This is similar to that.’ I thought that it might also train us to stereotype people, and think less of them. It got a lot worse than I ever thought it would. But I had my first concern back then.”\\nWhat AllSides does is clearly intended to be an antidote – and when I suggest that he is trying to reverse the march of forces far stronger than his somewhat niche website, Gable tells me that history may eventually favour his view of things. “We think of the printing press, and we think about the Enlightenment, and reformation,” he says. “We forget that for the first 100 years or so, there was great social chaos, before people created new things: libraries and publishers that were credible, so you could start distinguishing the better materials from the not-so-good materials.” He says the internet is stuck in “that early, chaotic stage”, but that AllSides and similar initiatives have a chance of “taking the 100 years of chaos from the printing press, and shortening it to about 15 years”.\\nAllSides, he tells me, has about 2 million users a month. The site also has a schools initiative that has taken it into all 50 US states, and that allows teachers to talk to their pupils about current affairs while swerving allegations of bias. But the intentions of this work, he says, are even more ambitious. “We actually have a whole programme about how teachers can train their kids to talk to each other, and listen, even when they disagree.”\\nWhat else, aside from visiting his site, does he think people trying to push beyond polarisation should change about their online habits?\\n“There are two things, really,” he says. “One is to create a friendship with somebody on the other side, politically. The way that change happens is person to person. The other thing is, with anything you believe, work at it so you can make a fantastic argument for the opposite point of view. Until you can really argue the other side, frankly, you don’t understand the issue.”\\nH aving spoken to Gable, I blow the dust off my Facebook account and make a few changes. On a whim, I decide to follow the Conservative party and a campaign called Brexit means Brexit, and send a couple of friend requests to prominent rightwing columnists, to no avail. I then spend the next couple of days flipping between OneSub and AllSides.\\nAllSides takes me to a rather nasty piece about homelessness in northern California that essentially says living on the street is a matter of personal choice; a piece about the Democratic party’s position on LGBT rights that tells me these things “are best handled locally and not by the inhabitant of the White House” (the lessons of the struggle against racial segregation, it seems, have rather dwindled); and different takes on Trump’s policy towards the Kurds that all serve to make me feel very bleak indeed. OneSub, meanwhile, continues to encourage me to see things – Brexit, conflict the Middle East, Trump’s possible impeachment – from three different perspectives and congratulates me when I do so. In so far as I am newly aware of views very different from my own, this all seems worthwhile. The problem is that I seem to remain stranded in a world of polarisation and mutual loathing, when I would like to be somewhere very different.\\nWhich takes me to Cathy Deng, who lives in San Francisco and works for the crowdfunding platform Patreon. Three years ago, she was at the research-and-development wing of the online news outlet BuzzFeed, working with people who were reeling from Trump’s victory, and worrying about what it said about the internet’s effects on politics. “When I joined, it was right after the 2016 election,” she says. “And a lot of people were talking about filter bubbles: ‘Oh, we are only getting information from people like ourselves.’ There were a lot of discussions about getting more things into your information feeds.”\\nMost of these conversations, she says, revolved around the division between Democrats and Republicans and so-called red and blue states. “But I felt like that was really reductive, because it reduces all the information in the world and all the different kinds of things you can be exposed to into one axis, and two sides. What you end up with is really just another kind of personalisation: ‘I am on the right, so I want more information from people on the left.’ That’s the same problem. The only true way to reject it is to go for randomness and serendipity. So that’s what I tried to do.”\\nHer answer was a gloriously simple Chrome plugin called Noisify. Once in place, it puts random nouns into Facebook’s search bar, presented in block capitals. “Aren’t you curious about … AIRCRAFT?” it asks me at one point; a few moments later, it is suggesting I search for TUITION, COMMAND, FACES and ARMENIA. Pursue these things, and then like or follow some of what comes up, and you begin to gently subvert Facebook’s algorithms, and your feed becomes smattered with stuff you might not previously have thought about. After two days of using Noisify, among other new sources of interest, I have started reading the local news in Tucson, Arizona, and been alerted to the dire effects of the climate crisis in the Maldives. Stranger still, the sense of dread with which I usually approach Mark Zuckerberg’s platform and my usual expectation of being greeted with either the mundane flotsam of people’s everyday lives or a great cacophony of anger have slightly subsided.\\n“Being exposed to new things is good for people’s brains,” Deng says. Whether the resulting pleasure is down to oxytocin, dopamine or some other brain chemical remains unclear – but the internet feels better than it has in ages.'], 'http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/28/donald-trump-won-the-debate-because-he-rejected-cr/': ['washingtontimes.com', 'The real reason Donald Trump won the debate', 'The Washington Times Https, Monica Crowley', datetime.datetime(2016, 9, 28, 0, 0), 'OPINION:\\nFour years ago, you could have almost seen Bill Clinton’s thought bubble as he watched Barack Obama’s weak and listless performance against Mitt Romney during the first presidential debate: “I can’t believe we lost to this guy.”\\nMr. Clinton never would have mailed it in the way Mr. Obama did. He may have lost some of his old magic, but he’s still got the golden touch.\\nHis wife, however, never had it — and clearly never will, as evidenced by her plodding and grating debate performance against Donald Trump this week. At the same time, Mr. Trump was aggressive, projecting authority even when he was on relatively shaky ground. Unlike others who have opposed her, he didn’t care that she was a Clinton or a Democrat or a woman. He didn’t defer to her, offer special treatment or allow her a wide berth for Clintonian parsing.\\nRelishing his outsider role, he positioned her squarely in her role of status quo incumbent. By doing so and by clearing the bar of appearing a reasonable man and plausible president, he lived to fight another day.\\nBecause he’s never done this before, voters give him a lot more running room to make mistakes and find his bearings. The fact that he more than held his own on the biggest political stage on earth is astounding. The traditional metrics don’t apply to this candidate or this election year, which is why he was able to walk away not just intact but perhaps stronger.\\nIn terms of political strengths, Mr. Trump appeared every bit the non-politician, the gifted television presence, the spontaneous and charismatic force of nature. Mrs. Clinton showcased her deep resume while presenting herself as the next historically unprecedented choice riding the next identity-politics wave.\\nIn terms of political weaknesses, Mr. Trump whiffed on hitting her on her private email server, the Clinton Foundation, leveraging her public position to enrich herself, Benghazi, her serial lying about all of this and more. He had flashes of impatience and defensiveness and often lapsed into self-reference when he should have kept his answers focused on the future of America.\\nMrs. Clinton, meanwhile, was predictably dissembling, non-transparent and obtuse while permitting the unknowns — particularly about her health — to remain unknown. She looked every inch the global elitist, and condescension dripped from her every pore. Not a good look for her.\\nIn terms of major narrative vulnerabilities, Mrs. Clinton could not speak convincingly of the Clinton Foundation, her server or email scandals nor of her portfolio as secretary of State (Libya, Benghazi specifically, the Russian reset, the rise of China, the Iranian nuclear deal, the failure to support key allies such as Israel, the decision to release known terrorists from Guantanamo Bay).\\nIt helped that she wasn’t asked about these things by the moderator, Lester Holt, who posed general questions to her while asking pointed questions to Mr. Trump, which forced him on the defensive. She also could not speak convincingly of the economy or Obamacare, given that she is the grandmother of socialized medicine and Obamacare is already in its predicted death spiral. Again, she got an assist from Mr. Holt, who didn’t bring it up.\\nMr. Trump struggled to speak convincingly about Russia or Ukraine or nuclear doctrine. But one of his best moments was when she tried to suggest that he’s unprepared for the presidency. The question, he said, isn’t whether she was in the game. It’s how she played it — and what results she produced: We are now less wealthy, less prosperous, less safe, less secure, less powerful.\\nOn the flip side, Mr. Trump enjoyed major narrative advantages, including the most feeble gross domestic product growth since the end of World War II under Mr. Obama and the attendant weakness in jobs and capital formation; illegal immigration and bad trade deals that have disadvantaged the working and middle classes; the breakdown of law and order in many American communities; and the need to defeat the corrupt, rigged system, reorganize relations with allies and foes, and reawaken American morale.\\nHe managed to exploit some of this, though it would have been more powerful if he had simply pointed to the smoking ruin of the Obama-Clinton economy and foreign policy and said, “We tried it your way.”\\nMrs. Clinton had the narrative advantage of the first Clinton administration economy, 1993-2001; the experience of having dealt with world leaders; Mr. Obama’s popularity; and beating up on Wall Street. Her failure to capitalize on many of these narrative strengths was a major communications failure.\\nDebates, however, are less about the nuances of policy and more about style, tone, well-timed zingers, and demonstrating the ability to think on one’s feet. He sprinted through the questions with the speed and agility of a leopard; she plodded through them with all of the grace of a three-legged rhinoceros.\\nThe scene is now set for the balance of the campaign. The race remains in the air, barring some unforeseen plot twist.\\nIn the end, however, Mr. Trump did one critical thing that went largely unnoticed. He stated implicitly — which he should have stated far more explicitly — that we don’t have to settle for the crippled America Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton have given us.\\nThe power to turn it around rests with us.\\nAnd by making that clear, Mr. Trump scored the only point that really matters.\\n• Monica Crowley is editor of online opinion at The Washington Times.'], 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/09/politics/jan-6-hearings-donald-trump-democracy/index.html': ['cnn.com', 'Jan. 6 panel holds prime-time televised hearing in a bid to imprint the implications of this national nightmare', 'Stephen Collinson', datetime.datetime(2022, 6, 9, 4, 5, 12), 'CNN —\\nThe House select committee on the Capitol insurrection has a duty far beyond investigating one of the most traumatic days in US history. Its wider mission is to expose and catalog an assault on democracy that is still going on.\\nThe panel holds its first prime-time televised hearing Thursday in a bid to imprint the implications of this national nightmare – when a mob incited by then-President Donald Trump tried to prevent the certification of 2020 election results – on the minds of citizens.\\nIt plans to show previously unseen video of testimony by former aides to Trump, campaign officials and members of Trump’s family.\\nCommittee aides said they will also roll video of the horrific scenes when pro-Trump rioters smashed their way into the Capitol building on January 6, 2021, beating up police officers and sending lawmakers running for safety.\\n“We’ll bring the American people back to the reality of that violence and remind them of just how horrific it was,” one aide said.\\nThe panel, which holds its first prime-time televised hearing Thursday in a bid to imprint the implications of this national nightmare on the minds of citizens, has often been compared to the Senate Watergate committee of the 1970s.\\nIn a climactic moment of those televised hearings that transfixed the nation, former White House counsel John Dean told of how he had informed disgraced President Richard Nixon that there was “a cancer” growing on the presidency. Fifty years later, as Washington still reels from the mendacity of another aberrant president, Trump, that cancer is attached to, and is still growing on, democracy itself.\\nThe House committee set out to expose the truth about Trump’s broad plot to tarnish the 2020 election with false claims of voter fraud. House Republicans are so determined to prevent the American people from learning that truth that they are working to discredit the committee with a public relations assault.\\nOn Thursday and in weeks of subsequent hearings the panel is under fierce pressure to establish the depth of Trump’s apparent conspiracy. Its work so far suggests it plans to prove that the attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob was not simply a rally that got out of hand but was the culmination of weeks of chicanery to subvert a free election by a President who called a crowd to Washington and incited an uprising against the American experiment itself.\\nThe committee is racing against the clock, since Republicans who are whitewashing Trump’s role as they seek to win back the House in midterm elections are sure to end its investigation.\\nBut in weeks of behind-the-scenes interviews that have reached deep into Trump’s West Wing, the committee has sought to establish, for example, the level of planning of the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, and whether there were direct links between the ex-President’s circle and partisan groups like the Proud Boys. Some leaders of the far-right extremist organization were this week charged by the Justice Department with seditious conspiracy in a bid to fracture the democratic transfer of power. Thursday’s hearing will feature testimony of two people who interacted with the group in early 2021.\\nThe hearings are also expected to stress the extraordinary breadth of the attempt to subvert the election, from Trump’s efforts to “find” votes to overturn his loss in Georgia to the extraordinary, and often hair-brained, schemes being pushed by Trump legal associates revealed in hundreds of text messages to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows that have been obtained by CNN. While the committee has no powers to lay criminal charges, it could recommend prosecutions of Trump or acolytes in a move that would place the Justice Department in the eye of a political storm in election year.\\nThe tumultuous political backdrop adds an extra layer of tension to Thursday’s big television showpiece.\\nIt would be one thing if the investigation was uncovering the plots and schemes and misdemeanors that took place during a tragedy that was in the past. But the ex-President is still spreading his lies about a stolen election. Many of those who are defending him, including GOP leaders in the House, want to stay in his good graces as they seek a return to power. And Trump is considering another White House campaign that might use the very same anti-democratic methods to claim a new term in office that would likely be more autocratic than the first.\\n“We are in fact in a situation where he continues to use even more extreme language, frankly, than the language that caused the attack,” committee member Rep. Liz Cheney, the Wyoming Republican and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, told CBS News in an interview this week.\\n“And so, people must pay attention. People must watch, and they must understand how easily our democratic system can unravel if we don’t defend it.”\\nThe committee faces a big challenge\\nWhile the committee has spent months conducting hundreds of interviews with witnesses, fighting legal battles with Trump acolytes who defied subpoenas and plowing through troves of documents, the circumstances of January 6, 2021, are intimately familiar to most Americans. That represents a challenge to the panel in creating a new understanding of the outrage since almost every potential viewer saw Trump trash the election for weeks and watched on television as his supporters marauded through Congress when it was certifying Biden’s 2020 win.\\nMany Americans are now more preoccupied with current crises, including record gasoline prices, a soaring cost of living and a pandemic that never seems to end, so the chances of the hearings stirring a new political awakening seem low. And many voters long ago made up their minds about Trump, an extremely polarizing figure who draws revulsion but also great partisan loyalty.\\nThe potential political impact of the hearings could be further diluted by the fact that they will be largely ignored by the powerful conservative news machine. Fox doesn’t plan to preempt its regular opinion programming to carry Thursday’s hearing live in its entirety, deferring to hosts who frequently distorted the events of January 6.\\nBut even 17 months on, events from that day remain shocking and historic.\\nIn 2020, a president lost a free and fair election but refused to accept defeat, mounted a prolonged attempt to discredit the result with lies about electoral fraud and then called a crowd to Washington and incited it, ahead of the first attack on the Capitol – the citadel of American representative government – in generations. For the first time in American history, a democratically defeated president tried to thwart the will of voters and disrupted the peaceful transfer of power, a golden thread that separates the United States from totalitarian states around the world.\\nGiven the earth-shaking implications, there was a strong push for the kind of independent commission held after previous national traumas, like the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963 or the September 11 attacks in 2001.\\nThe House passed a bipartisan bill setting up such a panel, but Senate Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell effectively killed it off, in implicit recognition of Trump’s strength among Republican voters. House GOP Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who – like McConnell – had originally condemned Trump’s role on January 6, then undermined a bipartisan House investigation by naming members like Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, who participated in Trump’s effort to undermine the election. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi then named two Republicans to the Democratic-led panel, Cheney and Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who have paid for their willingness to tell the truth about the insurrection by being ostracized by their party.\\nBroadly, the committee has been investigating the attempt by Trump to discredit the result of the election, why he didn’t quickly intervene to call off the insurrection and a wider attempt by pro-Trump conservative lawyers to subvert the Electoral College and to steal the presidency from Biden in Congress – a plan that then-Vice President Mike Pence, who had the constitutional duty of presiding over the certification of the votes, refused to go along with.\\nThe panel has multiple audiences: Americans who want to know what happened, potential voters in 2022 and 2024 concerned about Trump’s autocratic instincts and posterity.\\nCNN legal analyst Jennifer Rodgers, a former federal prosecutor, said the committee needs to drive a simple message concentrating on Trump’s role but also encompassing the totality of the broader plot.\\nShe said the hearings should focus on “not just January 6, (but) the misinformation campaign, the frivolous lawsuits, the fake electors scheme, the pressure on Mike Pence, the pressure on state legislators and state election officials, the planning of the January 6 rally, the involvement of congressional members … all leading to the insurrection.”\\n“They need to repeat, repeat, repeat: ‘This was the Trump coup.’”\\nA nation divided over the worst attack on democracy in history\\nThe culmination of the committee’s work is lent extra relevance by Trump’s continuing role as the de-facto leader of the Republican Party and his apparent intent to launch a new White House campaign. Therefore, the hearings have contemporary political as well as legal and historical implications. McCarthy, for instance, needs Trump’s help to become speaker if Republicans win the House in November. The proximity of the midterm vote also adds an extra political dimension, not least because Trump has tainted yet another election cycle with his claims of fraud in 2020 and is making adherence to his lies about a stolen election the price of entry for GOP candidates who want his endorsement.\\nA strong statement from the committee debunking Trump’s false claims would weaken the claims of Republicans he is seeking to leverage into positions of power in the states and in state legislatures to influence the administration of the 2024 election. Around the country, Republican leaders have meanwhile sought to use Trump’s lies as the foundation of efforts to suppress voting and to rein in options like mail-in balloting popular with Democratic voters.\\nThe deeply politicized mood in the country about Trump probably means the committee’s eventual findings will also be viewed through a partisan lens. A poll in April from the Washington Post and ABC News found that 40% of Americans believed the committee was conducting a fair and impartial investigation while 40% disagreed. In a CBS/YouGov poll in May, 89% of Democrats said it was at least somewhat important to find out what happened on January 6, 2021, while only 48% of Republicans believed so.\\nThis kind of national fracturing helps explain why the January 6 hearings almost certainly won’t have the same effect the Watergate television blockbusters had in 1973, which ultimately helped forced the resignation of Nixon.\\nYet, for the broader fate of American democracy, they might be even more important. In the conversation with Nixon that Dean referenced, caught on the taping system that ultimately led to the ex-President’s downfall, the ex-White House counsel said this: “There is a cancer within – close to the presidency, that’s growing. It’s growing daily.

To become a felony, prosecutors would have to prove the books were cooked with “an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof.” In Mr. Trump’s case, what is this second crime? The suggestion in the press is Mr. Bragg might say it’s a campaign-finance violation...An elected Democratic prosecutor is going to indict a Republican former President and 2024 contender, alleging a felony that could put him in prison, and it would boil down to a campaign-finance violation? That would be some precedent. To the public, it would sound as if Mr. Bragg is scrambling to come up with a legal theory to fit a target he had already decided he wanted to charge...And did Mr. Trump have “intent” to breach campaign-finance law? Even the New York Times, which threw fairness out the window during the Trump years, reports that, “The case against the former president hinges on an untested and therefore risky legal theory involving a complex interplay of laws, all amounting to a low-level felony.”\\nA convoluted legal bank-shot of a prosecution, relying on an \"untested\" and \"risky\" legal theory, is no way to go about something of this gravity. Nobody is above the law, Trump included, and we haven\\'t yet seen the entirety of whatever case Bragg\\'s office may bring against him. But it\\'s worth noting that the feds looked at this same evidence and made the prudential judgment not to charge Trump. For a partisan, elected DA in a very progressive city to go down this path will strike many Americans as plainly, highly political because it would be plainly, highly political. And it would be especially rich coming from Bragg, who is perhaps best known for downgrading felony charges -- including for violent offenses -- rather than conjuring up excuses to do the opposite. Here\\'s a relevant report from late 2022:\\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has downgraded more than half of his felony cases to misdemeanors as crime continues to escalate in the Big Apple. Since taking office on January 1, the soft-on-crime DA has downgraded 52 percent of felony cases to misdemeanors compared to 39 percent in all of 2019, according to data published on the DA\\'s website...Bragg, who campaigned last year on a promise of criminal justice reform, issued a controversial \\'Day One\\' memo after taking office stating he would only seek prison time in the most severe cases. That same month, career criminal William Rolon, who faced only misdemeanor charges for threatening a store worker with a knife, was told by a judge that he should \\'feel lucky\\' because of Bragg\\'s new policies. Violent crime in the Big Apple has soared by nearly 30 percent from last year.\\nWant some examples? Alvin Bragg gave a misdemeanor to a man who committed an anti-Semitic assault in Times Square, to a man who robbed a drug store at knifepoint, and to a man with 36 priors charged with grand larceny who proceeded to assault a woman on the street. pic.twitter.com/gcXISVBbWd — Greg Price (@greg_price11) March 18, 2023\\nIt is entirely consistent to believe (a) that Trump brought the Stormy Daniels ordeal upon himself, (b) that Trump is lying about the affair, and also (c) that Bragg\\'s reportedly-likely prosecution of him is politicized garbage. Politically speaking, I suspect this episode could result in a \\'rally around the flag\\' effect among Republican voters (as we saw after the Mar-a-Lago raid), who will see this as yet another left-wing witch hunt against the former president. Trump\\'s support may surge or consolidate as a consequence -- at least for awhile -- bolstering his standing in the 2024 primary race. Democrats have not been shy about admitting or telegraphing their desire to run against Trump again, so in that context, a Trump indictment and arrest might be seen as something of a win-win, from their perspective. Many within the \\'Resistance\\' base have wanted to see Trump incarcerated since the moment he won in 2016, so any movement in that direction will fill them with spiteful glee, even if the charges don\\'t stick. A prosecution, no matter how flimsy, will scratch an intense itch these people have experienced for years, having been routinely informed by their media echo chamber that the \\'walls were finally closing in\\' on the object of their hatred.\\nBut if it also has the knock-on effect of galvanizing GOP support for the man they\\'re confident they can beat again at the ballot box, all the better. Democrats look at the results of the 2018, 2020, and 2022 elections and reasonably conclude that Trump as the face of their opposition is helpful to their electoral prospects, so if a member of their tribe is going to abuse his office in order to satisfy the base, while simultaneously further cleaving the Republican base to Trump, all the better.

That’s the test the country faces in the coming days and possibly weeks, as election officials and potentially courts work to determine the winner of this year’s presidential election.\\nAmid one of the most logistically challenging and tightly contested elections in years, voters across the country are worried about everything from ballots getting lost to deceptive robocalls that told people to stay home on Election Day. But for many, their greatest fears have less to do with machines or mechanisms than with their fellow Americans.\\n“I think that Trump supporters will be more supportive if Biden wins than Biden supporters if Trump wins,” says Tabitha McQuait, standing in a field across from a brick church in Goldsboro, Pennsylvania, where dozens of voters have parked haphazardly in the grass.\\n“Sadly, I agree,” says her mom, Julie McQuait, echoing concerns voiced by Democrats as well. “Whichever candidate wins, I think the other party is going to take it poorly.”\\nWhy We Wrote This Reservoirs of goodwill and trust have been drained over the past two decades by increasing polarization in government, the media, and the public. Dozen of voters interviewed say they still trust the process – they just hope the other side will honor the results.\\n“My question is ... why don’t they have an auditing firm like Deloitte or somebody that comes in and oversees us?” asks the elder Ms. McQuait, who works at a local Fortune 500 company. “They oversee the lottery, why shouldn’t they oversee something as important as our country?”\\nWith the presidential race far closer than polls had predicted, and likely to hinge on a few narrowly contested swing states still tallying their ballots, the wait for an official result could test Americans’ trust in the system – and each other – like never before.\\nIn the two decades since the Supreme Court intervened to resolve Florida’s hanging chad controversy and put George W. Bush in the White House, increased political polarization has frayed the nation’s collective sense of trust and goodwill. Amid declining faith in institutions, the media, pollsters, and each other, the possibility of a disputed electoral outcome may only fuel Americans’ sense of suspicion and cynicism.\\n“One of the things that allows people to accept laws that are made and to accept the decisions made by their leaders is the acceptance that those leaders are there legitimately, whether they voted for them or not,” says Ryan Enos, a professor of government at Harvard University. “It’s really hard for society to function peacefully and for people to trust one another and many other things when they don’t believe that the people that are making laws for them are legitimate.”\\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, both candidates had a potential path to victory. But with outstanding votes in several key states expected to be heavily Democratic, Mr. Biden was seen as in a stronger position to win the needed 270 Electoral College votes, especially after swing state Wisconsin was called for him mid-afternoon. President Donald Trump, who has for months been sowing doubt about the reliability of mass mail-in voting, vowed in a speech in the wee hours of the morning to contest the results in the Supreme Court. (Any legal challenge would have to start in a lower court and be appealed to be considered by the nation’s highest court.)\\nPennsylvania – a closely contested state that last year enacted its most sweeping legislation on election administration in 80 years and overhauled voting systems in all 67 counties – could prove particularly messy. A 4-4 Supreme Court ruling on the eve of the election opened the way for the state to extend the deadline for receipt of mail-in votes to Friday, a move Republicans opposed. With recently confirmed Trump nominee Amy Coney Barrett now filling the ninth seat, a fresh case may yield a different decision.\\n“It’s just going to be just like back in Gore-Bush’s day, I got a feeling,” says Terry Morgan, a dock worker for a trucking company who voted for former Vice President Joe Biden in Goldsboro, Pennsylvania. “It’s going to take awhile to figure it out. One of the candidates is going to say, ‘I want this recounted.’”\\nIn fact, the Trump campaign announced Wednesday it planned to immediately request a recount in Wisconsin, where Mr. Biden was up about 20,000 votes. The former vice president is also leading the popular vote, with more votes than any candidate in U.S. history, which would make an Electoral College win for Mr. Trump even more difficult for liberal voters to swallow.\\nVoting amid a pandemic\\nFrom Salem, New Hampshire, to Santa Clarita, California, many voters leaving the polls on Election Day had concerns about the U.S. electoral system in this unusual election, held amid a pandemic.\\nOne of the top logistical problems cited was around mail-in ballots.\\nEli Bomer and his wife, who both voted for Mr. Trump, say they have confidence in the election process. Still, they came in person to vote at Wiley Canyon Elementary School in Santa Clarita because last time, they say, their absentee ballots were not counted.\\nAlthough Democrats more readily embraced mail-in voting, concerns about its reliability reach across the political spectrum.\\nSarah Matusek/The Christian Science Monitor New Yorker Yousef Murden, a sheet metal worker, chose to vote for Joe Biden in person on Election Day. \"Anything can happen in the mail,\" says Mr. Murden outside a Staten Island polling station. \"If I actually go vote on my own, I know it\\'s been counted.\"\\n“Anything can happen in the mail,” says Yousef Murden, an African American sheet metal worker with gold sneakers and camo pants outside a Staten Island, New York, polling station where he voted for Mr. Biden. “If I actually go vote on my own, I know it’s been counted.”\\nIn Pennsylvania, nine military ballots – all for Mr. Trump – were discarded, while up to 100 deposited in a California ballot box were damaged in an arson attempt. Then there’s the question of how many mail-in ballots might ultimately be invalidated.\\nMany states have signature-matching requirements, as well as postmark or arrival deadlines and other rules governing what constitutes a valid mailed ballot. Some of those laws have been challenged or changed on relatively short notice this year, in part due to concerns about in-person voting during a pandemic.\\nHenry Gass/The Christian Science Monitor Madeleine Johnson (left) and her mother, Krystin, hold the 1,000 cookies they baked for poll workers at the Pioneer Farms polling site in Austin, Texas, Nov. 3, 2020. While they trust the pandemic-altered voting process, they both said they\\'re worried ballots won\\'t be fairly counted.\\nIn Texas, where a legal challenge by four Republicans to toss out 127,000 ballots cast at drive-through polling sites failed in state and federal court, Austin voter Dené Cloud said her faith in the electoral process had been shaken by “people in positions of power trying to use any and every means to disqualify votes.”\\nBeyond concerns about the administration of the election, many voters are also worried that voters on the other side of the aisle won’t accept the results. A 2019 Pew Research Center survey found that while 53% of Americans express confidence that their fellow citizens will accept election results no matter who wins, 47% said they have “not too much” or “no confidence at all.”\\n“I don’t think it’s going to be very pretty if Mr. Trump wins,” says Veronica Linehan, a New Hampshire voter who says her brother disowned her after she voted for Mr. Trump in 2016. “[Democrats] just wouldn’t be able to accept it. It took four years and they still don’t accept that he’s president.”\\nSome experts trace that lack of faith to 2016, or President Barack Obama’s first victory in 2008, or even Mr. Bush’s 2000 win, when he captured Florida by just 537 votes after the Supreme Court halted a recount.\\nJohn, a voter in Brooklyn, who didn’t want to give his last name, says he was hoping for a landslide this year to spare confusion. But he says he believes civil unrest is inevitable no matter who wins. He voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, but says the president’s mishandling of the pandemic – in which he lost three co-workers and extended family, as well as his job – made him change his vote to Mr. Biden, whom he sees as the best candidate to unite a fractured nation. “Let’s start repairing – regardless of who wins,” he says.\\nWhen both sides think they’ve won\\nTwice in U.S. history, no presidential candidate received a majority of electors: the 1800 contest between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, and the four-way runoff with Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams in 1824. It took months for those elections to be sorted out, says David Greenberg, a presidential historian at Rutgers University in New Jersey.\\nBut a disputed election today comes in the context of building frustration and a widening partisan divide since the Bush versus Gore contest in 2000. The closer the election, the more ardent the claims of illegitimacy, says Professor Greenberg.\\n“Both sides right now are convinced they’re the rightful winners, even though they don’t know for sure,” he says. “So whichever way it breaks, people are going to be deeply, viscerally convinced that the country has been hijacked.”\\nMany voters interviewed by the Monitor expressed concern that the situation could spill over into civil unrest, with store owners from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to Portland, Oregon, preemptively boarding up their windows after a summer that saw many businesses damaged or looted amid the national protests over racial injustice.\\n“If you’re burning stuff down, you’re looting, you’re hurting people, that’s what’s going to divide the country. That’s what’s going to make people not accept election results,” says Steven Mosley, an African American voter wearing a Republican elephant mask outside a polling station in Alexandria, Virginia. “But if you just accept it and go, ‘OK, well I disagree. I’ll see you again in four years,’ that will unite the country.”\\nThe narrowly contested election, with possible legal challenges and concerns about the potential for violence, puts even more pressure on the eventual winner to bring the country together.\\n“It’s important that the next president be a statesman and appeal to our better angels and try at least to shift our political culture and make it possible for us to talk to each other again, regard each other with goodwill again, because democracy is going to be weakened the further we stray from that ideal,” says Professor Greenberg.\\nFor those feeling a sense of impending dread about how this all may play out, presidential historian Allan Lichtman insists that while there might be a lot of hand-wringing and maybe even some outbreaks of violence, whoever wins the Electoral College will become president – just as in the Bush versus Gore battle.\\nGet stories that\\nempower and uplift daily.

And we’re ready.”\\nPelosi’s decision followed months of Democratic infighting. She had also faced a barrage of criticism from the party’s activist base, which had begun to question her once-impeccable progressive credentials.\\nAnd the move comes with risks. Public opinion, for now, still remains against impeachment, and the inquiry could jeopardize her majority in 2020 while giving Trump a boost in his reelection bid.\\nBut Pelosi had also maintained her keen sense of the caucus, and knew that Democrats were erupting in the days after the Ukraine scandal began to unspool.\\nWhile on a plane back to Washington that night, Pelosi scrolled through a Washington Post op-ed that had published minutes earlier from seven vulnerable Democratic freshmen — and long-time impeachment holdouts — backing proceedings to remove Trump from office. The op-ed underscored how quickly the political ground was shifting among Democrats.\\nIn fact, Pelosi had spoken to the group on a conference call on Monday night, offering guidance before their op-ed went live.\\nShe then started jotting down notes, the first draft of her own speech endorsing an inquiry — words that would not only formalize the House investigation but potentially change the course of the nation and define her storied career.\\nBut there was a hiccup: “I put down some notes on the plane at 10 p.m. at night but then I left it on the plane,” Pelosi said.\\nLess than 24 hours later, after first informing her 235-member caucus of the decision in a private meeting, Pelosi walked out to a podium on the speaker’s balcony, in front of a wall of American flags, and spoke to the country.\\n“The president must be held accountable. No one is above the law,” Pelosi declared, describing Trump’s actions as a “betrayal of his oath of office.”\\nAnd then Pelosi went where she hadn’t been willing to go before publicly: “Therefore, today I’m announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.”\\nFor the Democrats who had been pressing for an impeachment probe for months — at times experiencing Pelosi’s wrath along the way — the speaker’s words were stunning. Just a week before, those very same Democrats were privately lamenting that their campaign to impeach Trump was quickly running out of time after several attempts to win public support had failed to materialize.\\nNow, the pro-impeachment forces feel vindicated.\\n“I’ve always thought it was inevitable,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said of impeaching Trump. “Here, he essentially bragged about what he had done. And the truth is plain to see. The Latin phrase is res ipsa loquitur — the thing speaks for itself.”\\n‘Let All This Mueller Stuff Go’\\nFour months earlier, Democratic leaders worried they were on the verge of losing control of the impeachment narrative.\\nIt was May 22, and two days before, Trump had barred former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before the House Judiciary Committee about the president’s alleged obstruction of justice.\\nFurious with Trump’s stonewalling — and the missed opportunity to hear from special counsel Robert Mueller’s star witness — a few members of Pelosi’s leadership team clashed with her privately over the issue and were now getting ready to break with the speaker and openly call for impeachment proceedings against the president.\\nSo Pelosi, who keeps a notoriously tight grip on her members, convened her lieutenants in bid to rein in the pro-impeachment revolt before it was too late.\\nThat was when Rep. Cheri Bustos, an Illinois moderate who chairs the House Democrats’ campaign arm, made a pronouncement that stunned the room.\\n“We just need to let all this Mueller stuff go,” Bustos said, according to three sources who attended the meeting.\\nBustos’ comment reflected a deepening sentiment among senior House leaders and a faction of Democratic moderates who wanted nothing to do with impeachment talk. Bustos has said publicly that she supports the House’s Mueller-related investigations, but she has also long argued that voters care more about kitchen-table issues.\\nBut to the faction of Democrats seeking formal impeachment proceedings, Bustos’ suggestion had come at precisely the moment they needed to get more aggressive with a hostile White House. The Trump administration would soon stonewall Congress on a host of subpoenas for witnesses and documents, effectively making a mockery of lawmakers’ constitutional oversight powers.\\nThat meeting was the beginning of a rupture that consumed the Democratic Caucus for months. It marked one of the first times Pelosi tried to walk the tightrope between the liberals who helped elect her as speaker and the moderates who delivered Democrats the House in 2018 — a delicate balancing act that became ever more difficult to manage.\\nIt was also when Democrats who backed impeachment made a conscious choice: they weren’t going to simply fall in line with their party leaders and were going to continue organizing colleagues to join the impeachment cause.\\n“I believe we had enough to file articles of impeachment right after the [Mueller] report initially came out,” said Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), one of just three lawmakers who sits on both the Judiciary and Intelligence committees.\\nIn the weeks and months following the release of the Mueller report, pro-impeachment Democrats believed that the holdouts in the caucus were underestimating Trump’s ability to “self-impeach” through his actions and penchant to seek revenge against political enemies.\\n“I feel like we were indecisive and overly cautious,” said Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), an early impeachment supporter. “And frankly we did way too much political parsing when we should have taken this obvious bombshell, added it to the many other obvious impeachable bombshells that we already had, and begun doing our job.”\\nBut the caucus was divided and the fracture was getting harder to ignore.\\nPelosi and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) had been sparring for months over the issue. Just last week, Pelosi criticized the Judiciary Committee’s handling of impeachment in harsh terms behind closed doors and even encouraged people in the room to leak her complaints.\\nAnd then, just as the impeachment effort appeared to be sputtering, everything changed.\\nA nondescript, late-night press release from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) landed in reporters’ inboxes on Sept. 13 revealing the existence of an intelligence community whistleblower that the Trump administration had refused to let talk to Congress. Within days, the Trump-Ukraine scandal had exploded across Washington.\\nPelosi Makes Her Move\\nThe calls started rolling in to Pelosi in earnest last Friday night.\\nEarlier that week, the Washington Post had revealed details about a mysterious whistleblower complaint being withheld from Congress. It involved a “promise” Trump made while talking with a foreign leader.\\nThen a blockbuster follow-up report from the Wall Street Journal a few day later blew apart Democratic leaders’ delicately knitted attempt to hold off an impeachment investigation. The report detailed how Trump “repeatedly” pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son in a July phone call while simultaneously withholding military aide from the country.\\nFor many Democrats, that was what was missing from previous Trump scandals. Trump was allegedly using his office to extort a foreign leader to help benefit his reelection campaign, a move that smacked of the Richard Nixon era for many in the party.\\n“Here we’re talking about potentially ongoing, gross abuses of power. We’re talking about a sitting president, not a candidate for president. And we’re talking about the current campaign, not a past campaign,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) said in an interview just minutes after viewing the classified whistleblower complaint in the Intelligence Committee’s underground bunker at the Capitol Wednesday night.\\nAs the Ukraine scandal quickly ballooned, progressive activists got restless. Late Saturday night, freshman liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) wrote on Twitter that Democratic leaders’ refusal to impeach Trump was “the bigger national scandal” than the president’s “lawbreaking behavior.”\\nBut Pelosi wasn’t going to rush into any decision. She was a rising backbencher when the House impeached President Bill Clinton in 1998, and she knew that impeachment proceedings against Trump would be just as divisive to the nation.\\nPelosi was also convinced that it would distract from her party’s legislative priorities on health care and drug costs, gun violence and other key issues. The Democratic domestic agenda — as well as Trump’s growing unpopularity in the suburbs — had driven the party to a huge House win in November and vaulted Pelosi back into the speaker’s chair after eight years in the minority.\\nThe California Democrat also knew that Trump’s stranglehold over the GOP meant no Republicans were going to back impeachment unless there was an air-tight case against the president. And she feared that impeaching Trump on partisan lines was a risk to the Democratic majority.\\nSo Pelosi took the heat from the Democratic base — and within her own caucus — over her resistance to impeachment. She at times grew exasperated by the criticism, privately clashing with some members of her leadership team while asserting publicly that Trump “isn’t even worth” impeaching.\\nOne other important factor weighed heavily on Pelosi — her “frontline” members in the toughest swing districts were overwhelmingly opposed to impeaching Trump, and some had directly toldher so. It was her duty to represent the whole caucus, so Pelosi did what she felt she had to do as speaker: Say no to impeachment.\\nBut the Ukraine scandal upended all that.\\nBy Saturday morning, Pelosi informed her staff to be ready to prepare a statement endorsing an impeachment inquiry. She continued to field calls from dozens of Democrats throughout the weekend in between delivering back-to-back eulogies — first for the veteran journalist Cokie Roberts on Saturday and then for Mrs. Clyburn in South Carolina on Sunday.\\nDozens of other House Democrats had also traveled to South Carolina to pay their respects to Emily, Clyburn’s wife of 58 years. But on the sidelines of the weekend’s memorial events, impeachment chatter dominated the conversations.\\n“She was in regular contact with the entire spectrum of the House Democratic Caucus over the last few days,” said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.).\\nMeanwhile, a thousand miles away, other Democrats were also coming to their own painful conclusions about Trump’s alleged behavior and what needed to be done.\\n‘I’ve Done My Job’\\nFor two of Minnesota’s vulnerable Democrats, the move to support impeaching Trump was a deeply personal decision made at 30,000 feet.\\nRep. Dean Phillips emailed his staff to inform them he’d decided to endorse an impeachment inquiry while on a flight returning to Washington on Sunday. On her own D.C.-bound flight the next day, Rep. Angie Craig, who sits in a bordering district, said her thinking also crystalized mid-air.\\nWhen the two of them spoke on a panel on Capitol Hill Monday, Craig pulled Phillips aside afterward to tell him of her decision to call for an impeachment inquiry — and learned that he’d already drafted a similar statement to release that afternoon.\\nWithin hours, the two Minnesota freshmen became the first battleground Democrats to back impeachment following Trump’s own admission that he pressured Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden. It was the beginning of a wave of support that would ultimately push the number of impeachment inquiry backers in the House to a majority — 218 members — by midweek.\\n“At the end of the day, I asked myself, if this were a Democratic president with exactly the same set of admissions, or behavior, would I have the courage to stand up and call for an inquiry on my own Democratic president?” Craig said in an interview.\\nIn Washington, much of the attention on the shift within the caucus has focused on the seven battleground freshmen who published the op-ed on Monday night. That 427-word statement came after days of nonstop texts and conference calls among a tight-knit group of lawmakers who all have backgrounds in national security, including in the military and CIA.\\n“At the end of the day, I asked myself, if this were a Democratic president with exactly the same set of admissions, or behavior, would I have the courage to stand up and call for an inquiry on my own Democratic president?” Rep. Angie Craig\\nBut Trump himself contributed to the momentum for impeachment as well. Many Democrats say it was Trump’s defiant comments on Sunday, directly acknowledging that he had spoken to Ukrainian officials about investigating Biden, that made lawmakers feel they could no longer ignore the situation.\\nSome called senior members in their state delegations and conferred with Pelosi about how to proceed. Others were deciding at home with family or out in their districts. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Mich.), who endorsed an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, made up her mind while speaking at a Democratic picnic near a playground where she grew up.\\nSome freshmen were still deliberating when they returned to Washington on Tuesday, where the issue came up at a closed-door meeting of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition and resistance to impeachment lingered.\\nRep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who survived the Democratic wipeout in the 2010 midterms, offered a warning to the undecided freshmen in the room.\\n“Don’t get caught up with the party,” the conservative Democrat cautioned. Other party elders, like Reps. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.), nodded in agreement, according to multiple people in the room.\\nCuellar and Schrader are among the few remaining Blue Dogs who lived through the party’s humiliating defeat eight years earlier, when the moderate caucus’ ranks were depleted by half after a series of tough votes, including on Obamacare.\\nThis time, if Democrats were going to take a vote that could wipe them out, Cuellar said they needed to vote their conscience.\\nMultiple freshmen in competitive districts said that they tried to put politics aside. But they couldn’t entirely ignore the idea that impeachment could cost them their seat.\\n“If I serve one term, and do it with honor and principle, and lose because of that, so be it. I’ve done my job,” Phillips said. “Has it crossed my mind? Of course. But it’s very liberating to reflect my truth, and I think the nation’s truth.”\\n‘Give Us A Goddamn Message’\\nHours before her historic announcement on Tuesday, Pelosi received a call from Trump. The conversation was ostensibly about gun control, but Trump veered into the Ukraine controversy.\\nTrump then told Pelosi that he wasn’t personally holding up the whistleblower complaint. “Well, then undo it,” she told him, relaying the conversation to lawmakers later in the day.\\nBut even after it became clear that an impeachment inquiry was inevitable, Democrats were still far from agreement over the actual mechanics of it.\\nSwing-district lawmakers, in particular, were actively pushing Democratic leaders to adopt an entirely new strategy from their Mueller days — one that didn’t involve what they saw as overly aggressive members of the House Judiciary Committee.\\nOn Tuesday morning, a handful of Judiciary Committee members met with some of the national security-minded freshmen who wrote the op-ed the night before. The meeting was organized by Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (D-Fla.), another vulnerable freshman Democrat who also sits on the Judiciary panel.\\nThe Judiciary members had a key goal: Convince these influential freshmen that their panel was best equipped to carry out an impeachment proceedings, rather than a select committee handpicked by party leaders, as some moderate lawmakers had been advocating for in recent days.\\nStill a concern of many was a circus-like hearing the week before featuring former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who sparred with Democrats and defiantly refused to answer questions about his role in the Mueller investigation.\\nDemocrats privately described the showdown — the first public hearing with a Mueller-report witness — as an embarrassment, and they blamed Nadler for the mess. Pelosi herself said in a closed-door meeting that she would haveheld Lewandowski in contempt immediately, a comment several attendees viewed as a dig at Nadler.\\nJudiciary Committee members pushed back during the meeting with frontliners, arguing that they understood the gravity of the Ukraine scandal and why it was different than the myriad other investigations Democrats have been pursuing against Trump.\\nIn fact, Democratic leaders are now coalescing around a strategy to narrow the focus of their impeachment inquiry to the Ukraine scandal, in part because it has unified the party in outrage.\\nIn the end, the Judiciary members won out and Nadler’s starring role in the impeachment drive was preserved. Pelosi held a private meeting with six committee chairs on Tuesday afternoon and told them to come up with their best cases for impeachment and send them to the Judiciary Committee for potential consideration of impeachment articles.\\nYet even after Pelosi helped steer the party to an impeachment inquiry, holding her members together over the next critical weeks and months could prove difficult.\\nA closed-door session with the full caucus on Tuesday made that clear, as some moderates complained that they weren’t being given a well-defined message to deliver to voters about why proceeding toward impeachment was necessary on Trump’s Ukraine maneuverings.\\nRep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) was the most colorful, grousing that Democratic leaders needed to “give us a goddamn message to stay on,” according to lawmakers and aides in the room.\\n“I think we all know we’re at a historic moment,” Slotkin later told reporters. “Obviously we have a lot of investigations already ongoing. But I think it’s important that we focus on this one. It’s clear, it’s understandable, it’s strategic, and we need to bring along the country with us.”'], 'https://www.vox.com/2019/12/18/21029287/trump-impeachment-battle-creek-michigan-rally': ['vox.com', 'Trump responds to impeachment with ugly rally in Battle Creek, Michigan', 'Aaron Rupar, Shirin Ghaffary, Ari Saperstein, Dylan Scott, Nicole Narea, Ian Millhiser, Li Zhou, Dec', datetime.datetime(2019, 12, 18, 23, 1, 59), 'President Donald Trump’s response to the House of Representatives’ approval of two articles of impeachment against him was, in some respects, even uglier than could’ve reasonably been anticipated. And given Trump’s track record, that’s saying something.\\nAt the exact moment the House approved the first article of impeachment, Trump was 600 miles away at a rally in Battle Creek, Michigan, telling a relatively innocuous, absurd tale he’s repeatedly told about how the military’s stealth planes are literally invisible.\\nI’m case you’re we’re wondering what Trump was saying at the exact moment they reached 216 votes for impeachment, it was another insane story about how he thinks stealth fighters are actually invisible. pic.twitter.com/IPlRHinz2m — Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) December 19, 2019\\nThings took a darker turn from there, however. Instead of backing away from the conspiracy theories about the Bidens that are at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, Trump leaned into them, at one point claiming that if he did what the Bidens have done, “they’d bring the electric chair back.” Though that said more about his sense of victimization by House Democrats, its underlying assumption is that former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter did something criminal. But the bad optics of Hunter Biden serving in a lucrative position on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at the same time as his father was involved in Ukraine policy aside, there’s not a shred of evidence supporting Trump’s claims.\\nAt other points during the rally, Trump basked in “lock her up!” chants directed at Hillary Clinton, and suggested she might end up behind bars. (The crowd also directed “lock her up” chants at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier in the night, when Vice President Mike Pence was on stage.) He heaped scorn on the Democrat who oversaw the House Intelligence Committee impeachment hearings, chair Adam Schiff, calling him “not the best looking guy I’ve ever seen,” and on former FBI Director James Comey, saying “Did I do a great job when I fired his ass?”\\nBut the lowest moment of the night came when Trump attacked Debbie Dingell, a Democratic congresswoman from the state he was speaking in, for voting in favor of impeachment. He even went as far as suggesting that her husband, the late World War II veteran and former congressman John Dingell, whose seat she now holds, is in hell.\\nTrump began his attack on Dingell by suggesting she owed him something for allowing her husband to have a state funeral after he passed away earlier this year. He claimed Debbie Dingell called him and thanked him.\\n“‘He’s looking down, he’d be so thrilled. Thank you so much sir,’” Trump said, paraphrasing Debbie, before going on to suggest that heaven is not where John Dingell ended up. “I said, ‘Don’t worry about it.’ Maybe he’s looking up — I don’t know.”\\nThe response of Trump’s audience to those comments indicated it may have been a bit much even for them.\\nTrump laments that Debbie Dingell voted to impeach him despite the fact that he allowed the normal state funeral to proceed for her late husband, former Rep.

My husband earned all his accolades after a lifetime of service. I’m preparing for the first holiday season without the man I love.

Debbie Dingell (@RepDebDingell) December 19, 2019\\nDingell wasn’t the only woman Trump targeted with comments that were in extremely poor taste. Early during his speech, after protesters unfurled a banner that read “DON THE CON. YOU’RE FIRED!” Trump responded by calling a woman protester “a real slob” and lamented that security guards weren’t rougher with her while kicking her out of the arena.\\nTrump disses a woman protester: \"There is a slob, there is a real slob ...

He claimed that the “lawless partisan impeachment is a political suicide march for the Democrat party,” even though a Fox News poll that was released on Sunday showed a majority of registered voters favoring the course of action the House took on Wednesday.\\nTrump also played the victim, whining about how hard impeachment has been on his family.\\nTRUMP whines about impeachment: \"But it\\'s my life.

The reason for this is simple: Ours is a government of laws, not of men, as John Adams once observed. Nobody, not even a president, is above those laws.\\nSo why did I feel nauseous yesterday, watching coverage of the FBI executing a search warrant at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate?\\nBecause this country is tracking toward a scale of political violence not seen since the Civil War. It’s evident to anyone who spends significant time dwelling in the physical or virtual spaces of the American right. Go to a gun show. Visit a right-wing church. Check out a Trump rally. No matter the venue, the doomsday prophesying is ubiquitous—and scary. Whenever and wherever I’ve heard hypothetical scenarios of imminent conflict articulated, the premise rests on an egregious abuse of power, typically Democrats weaponizing agencies of the state to target their political opponents. I’ve always walked away from these experiences thinking to myself: If America is a powder keg, then one overreach by the government, real or perceived, could light the fuse.\\nThink I’m being hysterical? I’ve been accused of that before. But we’ve seen what happens when millions of Americans abandon their faith in the nation’s core institutions. We’ve seen what happens when millions of Americans become convinced that their leaders are illegitimate. We’ve seen what happens when millions of Americans are manipulated into believing that Trump is suffering righteously for their sake; that an attack on him is an attack on them, on their character, on their identity, on their sense of sovereignty. And I fear we’re going to see it again.\\nDavid A. Graham: The Mar-a-Lago raid proves the U.S. isn’t a banana republic\\nIt’s tempting to think of January 6, 2021, as but one day in our nation’s history. It’s comforting to view the events of that day—the president inciting a violent mob to storm the U.S. Capitol and attempt to overturn the results of a free and fair election—as the result of unprecedented conditions that happened to converge all at once, conditions that are not our national norm.\\nBut perhaps we should view January 6 as the beginning of a new chapter.\\nIt’s worth remembering that Trump, who has long claimed to be a victim of political persecution, threatened to jail his opponent, Hillary Clinton, throughout the 2016 campaign, reveling in chants of “Lock her up!” at rallies nationwide. (Republicans did not cry foul when the FBI announced an investigation into Clinton just days before the election.) It was during that campaign—as I traveled the country talking with Republican voters, hoping to understand the Trump phenomenon—that I began hearing casual talk of civil war. Those conversations were utterly jarring. People spoke matter-of-factly about amassing arms. Many were preparing for a day when, in their view, violence would become unavoidable.\\nI remember talking with Lee Stauffacher, a 65-year-old Navy veteran, outside an October Trump rally in Arizona. “I’ve watched this country deteriorate from the law-and-order America I loved into a country where certain people are above the law,” Stauffacher said. “Hillary Clinton is above the law. Illegal immigrants are above the law. Judges have stopped enforcing the laws they don’t agree with.”\\nStauffacher went on about his fondness of firearms and his loathing of the Democratic Party. “They want to turn this into some communist country,” he said. “I say, over my dead body.”\\nDavid Frum: Stuck with Trump\\nThis sort of rhetoric cooled, for a time, after Trump’s victory. But then came Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference and possible collusion. And the subsequent arrests of some of the president’s closest confidants. Then came the first impeachment of Trump himself. By the time his reelection campaign got under way, Trump was fashioning himself a wartime president, portraying himself on the front lines of a pitched battle between decent, patriotic Americans and a “deep state” of government thugs who aim to enforce conformity and silence dissent.\\nOn December 18, 2019, the day he was impeached for the first time, Trump tweeted a black-and-white photo that showed him pointing into the camera. “THEY’RE NOT AFTER ME … THEY’RE AFTER YOU,” read the caption. “I’M JUST IN THE WAY.”\\nAs I hit the road again in 2020, crisscrossing the nation to get a read on the Republican base, it was apparent that something had changed. There was plenty of that same bombast, all the usual chesty talk of people taking matters into their own hands. But whereas once the rhetoric had felt scattered—rooted in grievances against the left, or opposition to specific laws, or just general discomfort with a country they no longer recognized—the new threats seemed narrow and targeted. Voter after voter told me there had been a plot to sabotage Trump’s presidency from the start, and now there was a secretive plot to stop him from winning a second term. Everyone in government—public-health officials, low-level bureaucrats, local election administrators—was in on it. The goal wasn’t to steal the election from Trump; it was to steal the election from them.\\n“They’ve been trying to cheat us from the beginning,” Deborah Fuqua-Frey told me outside a Ford plant in Michigan that Trump was visiting during the early days of the pandemic. “First it was Mueller, then it was Russia. Isn’t it kind of convenient that as soon as impeachment failed, we’ve suddenly got this virus?”\\nI asked her to elaborate.\\n“The deep state,” she said. “This was domestic political terrorism from the Democratic Party.”\\nThis kind of thinking explains why countless individuals would go on to donate their hard-earned money—more than $250 million in total—to an “Election Defense Fund” that didn’t exist. It explains why others swarmed vote-counting centers, intimidated poll workers, signed on to shoddy legal efforts, flocked to fringe voices advocating solutions such as martyrdom and secession from the union, threatened to kill elections officials, boarded buses to Washington, and ultimately stormed the United States Capitol.\\nWhat made January 6 so predictable—the willingness of Republican leaders to prey on the insecurities and outright paranoia of these voters—is what makes August 8 so dangerous.\\n“The Obama FBI began spying on President Trump as a candidate,” Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee tweeted this morning. “If they can do this to Trump, they will do it to you!”\\n“If they can do it to a former President, imagine what they can do to you,” read a tweet from Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee. They followed up: “The IRS is coming for you. The DOJ is coming for you. The FBI is coming for you. No one is safe from political punishment in Joe Biden’s America.”\\n“If there was any doubt remaining, we are now living in a post constitutional America where the Justice Department has been weaponized against political threats to the regime, as it would in a banana republic,” the Texas Republican Party tweeted. “It won’t stop with Trump. You are next.”\\nAdam Serwer: Conservatives believe Trump is above the law\\nIt won’t stop with Trump—that much is certain. The House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, all but promised retaliation against the Justice Department should his party retake the majority this fall. Investigations of President Joe Biden and his son Hunter were already more or less guaranteed; the question now becomes how wide of a net congressional Republicans, in their eagerness to exact vengeance on behalf of Trump and appease a fuming base, cast in probing other people close to the president and his administration.\\nAssuming that Trump runs in 2024, the stakes are even higher. If Biden—or another Democrat—defeats him, Republicans will have all the more reason to reject the results, given what they see as the Democrats’ politically motivated investigation of the likely Republican nominee. If Trump wins, he and his hard-line loyalists will set about purging the DOJ, the intelligence community, and other vital government departments of careerists deemed insufficiently loyal. There will be no political cost to him for doing so; a Trump victory will be read as a mandate to prosecute his opponents. Indeed, that seems to be exactly where we’re headed.\\n“Biden is playing with fire by using a document dispute to get the @TheJusticeDept to persecute a likely future election opponent,” Senator Marco Rubio of Florida tweeted. “Because one day what goes around is going to come around.”\\nAnd then what? It feels lowest-common-denominator lazy, in such uncertain times, to default to speculation of 1860s-style secession and civil war. But it’s clearly on the minds of Americans. Last year, a poll from the University of Virginia showed that a majority of Trump voters (52 percent) and a strong minority of Biden voters (41 percent) strongly or somewhat agreed that America is so fractured, they would favor red and blue states seceding from the union to form their own countries. Meanwhile, a poll from The Washington Post and the University of Maryland showed that one in three Americans believes violence against the government is justified, and a separate poll by NPR earlier this year showed that one in 10 Americans believes violence is justified “right now.”\\nIt’s hard to see how any of this gets better. But it’s easy to see how it gets much, much worse.\\nWe don’t know exactly what the FBI was looking for at Mar-a-Lago. We don’t know what was found. What we must acknowledge—even those of us who believe Trump has committed crimes, in some cases brazenly so, and deserves full prosecution under the law—is that bringing him to justice could have some awful consequences.\\nIs that justice worth the associated risks? Yesterday, the nation’s top law-enforcement officers decided it was.

No one understands the story the same way\\nFor example, although the ambassador said that eventually, it became clear to him that Ukrainian commitments were the key that would unlock a meeting with Trump and — eventually, roughly $391 million in U.S. assistance — Sondland also said he didn\\'t realize the target was former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\\nOnly within the past few months, when evidence emerged including the White House record of Trump\\'s phone call on July 25 with Zelenskiy, did Sondland tie the phrase often used, \"Burisma,\" which is a reference to the Ukrainian company that paid Hunter Biden, to Trump and the election.\\n\"It was always \\'Burisma\\' to me, and I didn\\'t know about the connection between Burisma and Biden,\" he said.\\n2. There are credibility questions\\nImpeachment inquisitors in both parties were dubious about that claim and other aspects of Sondland\\'s testimony.\\nThe ambassador said that he\\'s \"not a note-taker\" and that he often relies on others\\' records.\\nSondland already has revised the deposition he gave behind closed doors in an earlier phase of this inquiry, and questioners on Wednesday pressed him about what he called gaps in his recollection or whether he was stating a fact or making an inference.\\nBut Sondland also said the White House and the State Department won\\'t release some documents and other materials to his attorneys — a theme that chimed with Democrats\\' complaint about what they\\'ve called obstruction by Trump.\\nOne question raised Wednesday was whether the hearing would move the needle with the Trump administration and prompt it to begin releasing records related to Sondland or other witnesses in the impeachment case.\\n3. Sondland said Trump never outlined a quid pro quo\\nSondland, rare among the players in the drama, has the ability to talk directly to Trump — and did on about 20 occasions, he said.\\nSondland called Trump on his mobile phone from a restaurant in Kyiv, for example, and the president asked him in that conversations about the \"investigations\" he wanted the Ukrainians to launch.\\nBut Trump himself never explicitly spelled out the crux of the Ukraine affair, Sondland said — never said that if the Ukrainians made the public statements the American side requested, there would be a White House meeting and the release of the assistance appropriated by Congress.\\nSondland told members of Congress that he and others inferred that was what was behind the U.S. policy. So the ambassador delivered that crucial message to a Ukrainian counterpart in Poland: Zelenskiy would need to make an announcement in order to move ahead with U.S. engagement.\\nSondland did confer with Pompeo, Trump\\'s lawyer Rudy Giuliani, diplomatic colleagues and others, he said. But in an exchange with Republican counsel Steve Castor, the ambassador gave the answer on which Republicans can preserve the foundation for a continued defense of Trump:\\n\"Did the president ever tell you personally about any preconditions for anything?\" Castor asked.\\n\"No,\" Sondland said.\\n4. Testimony raises questions about political heat for others\\nPence and Pompeo haven\\'t figured heavily in the Ukraine affair since it took over much of the agenda in Washington.\\nBut an earlier understanding of the story as a \"shadow\" or back-channel conduit from Trump via Giuliani, Sondland and other \"three amigos\" was exploded by Sondland\\'s account on Wednesday.\\nThe ambassador plotted diplomatic strategy directly with Pompeo, Sondland testified. For example, Sondland asked whether he should try to arrange contact between Trump and Zelenskiy in Poland when the American president was scheduled to travel there.\\nSondland could prime Zelenskiy about the need to tell Trump that once his \"justice folks\" were operating, they would move ahead with investigations, the ambassador wrote.\\n\"Yes,\" Pompeo responded, according to an email that Sondland produced — although Trump never made the trip.\\nInstead, Pence did — and Sondland said he conferred with him about the U.S. aid for Ukraine that had been frozen by the White House.\\n\"I mentioned to Vice President Pence before the meetings with the Ukrainians that I had concerns that the delay had become tied to the issue of investigations,\" Sondland said.\\nContinued Sondland: \"I recall mentioning that before the Zelenskiy meeting. During the actual meeting, President Zelenskiy raised the issue of security assistance directly with Vice President Pence, and the vice president said that he would speak to President Trump about it.\"\\nSondland told members of Congress that Pence \"nodded\" but otherwise didn\\'t respond.\\nAll the codes and euphemisms complicate the story, however. Pence\\'s office said on Wednesday that the vice president never had a conversation about \"investigating the Bidens, Burisma, or the conditional release of financial aid.\"\\nBut Sondland said he never had the full picture himself, and in his testimony, he said he got the impression that Pence followed what was taking place.\\n\"He didn\\'t say, \\'Gordon, what are you talking about\\'?\" asked Democratic counsel Daniel Goldman. \"He didn\\'t say, \\'What investigations?\\' \"\\nResponded Sondland: \"No, he did not.\"\\n5. Sondland could mark a shift in the Ukraine affair\\nHistory may record that Wednesday divided the Ukraine affair into \"before\" and \"after\" phases — Sondland\\'s testimony verified so many facts from earlier witnesses and expanded so much public understanding that the saga appears likely to evolve once more.\\nThe way the Ukraine affair plays out in Washington may shift from factual questions about what happened to more political ones about whether what took place was appropriate.\\nRepublicans and Democrats both have been laying the groundwork for that for some time, each emphasizing different aspects of the case.\\nRepublicans argue that, in the final analysis, there was no wrongdoing.

Under Chris Licht, CNN’s new chairman and CEO, the network is embracing middle-of-the-road newscasting and has parted ways with high-profile staffers who spoke in blunt terms about Trump’s behavior in office. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight If the former president is grateful, he’s not showing it. Trump filed suit against CNN on Monday, alleging that it has strived “to defame [Trump] in the minds of its viewers and readers for the purpose of defeating him politically.” This culminated “in CNN claiming credit for ‘[getting] Trump out’ in the 2020 presidential election,” according to the complaint filed in a Florida federal court.\\nTrump is seeking $475 million in punitive damages. Like other Trump lawsuits, this one lacks substance — more bluntly, it’s garbage — with its only utility being as a guide to this country’s wide-ranging First Amendment protections. CNN, in earlier correspondence with Trump excerpted in the legal filing, told the former president’s counsel, “While we will address the merits of any lawsuit should one be filed, we note that you have not identified a single false or defamatory statement in your letter.”\\nAdvertisement\\nAlthough Trump’s financial demands run to nine figures, the document behind them is a flimsy 29 pages. It takes issue with statements aired on CNN that accuse Trump of pushing the “big lie” and that characterize him with the “false ... and defamatory labels of ‘racist,’ ‘Russian lackey,’ ‘insurrectionist,’ and ultimately ‘Hitler.’ ” The most facially laughable of these, of course, is “Russian lackey,” which is not only an innocuous put-down but also rests, in part, on one of the most infamous moments in U.S. diplomatic history — when then-President Trump sided with Russia over U.S. intelligence regarding Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\\nFollow Erik Wemple 's opinions Follow\\nThe other allegedly “defamatory labels” are no such thing. Here are a few claims in the complaint, followed by explanations as to why they aren’t defamatory:\\n· Psychiatrist Allen Frances told then-CNN host Brian Stelter in August 2019, “Trump is as destructive a person in this century as Hitler, Stalin and Mao were in the last century.” Frances also said: “He may be responsible for many more million deaths than they were. He needs to be contained but he needs to be contained by attacking his policies, not his person. It’s crazy for us to be destroying the climate our children will live in. It’s crazy to be giving tax cuts to the rich that will add trillions of dollars to the debt our children will have to pay. It’s crazy to be destroying our democracy by claiming that the press and the courts are the enemy of the people.” Trump argues in his complaint that PolitiFact cited part of Frances’s statement as a “Pants on Fire” falsehood.\\nAdvertisement\\nThis was a dark moment for CNN. Stelter later admitted that he should have challenged Frances (he cited technical problems, saying he hadn’t heard the statement). But the unspecific nature of the commentary and the way it’s couched — that Trump “may be” responsible for the deaths — place it in the realm of rhetorical hyperbole. Shameless commentary isn’t always libelous. “I’m reasonably confident that a court would rule that, taken in context, that passage is an expression of opinion by Dr. Frances about the human toll of policies Trump pursued, which is protected by the First Amendment,” Lee Levine, a longtime media defense attorney, tells me by email.\\n· House Democrats in March 2019 likened aspects of Trump’s rise to Hitler’s, as CNN reported then. According to the suit, “the ‘reporting’ is nothing more than self-serving pronouncements by political opponents of [Trump] and their news proxy (and political participant), CNN.”\\nRead the statements in question, and it’s clear why they’re not remotely defamatory. For instance, House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) said, “Adolf Hitler was elected chancellor of Germany. And he went about the business of discrediting institutions to the point that people bought into it.” Clyburn also said: “Nobody would have believed it now. But swastikas hung in churches throughout Germany. We had better be very careful.”\\nAdvertisement\\nTo defame someone, you must make a false statement that purports to be a fact about that person. In this instance, Clyburn is speaking to historical parallels and political trends, not launching the sort of ad hominem attacks necessary to win a defamation claim.\\n· CNN host Jake Tapper said on a show in January 2022: “There is a reason Trump was in Arizona, to push the legislature to disenfranchise the state’s voters based on all of his deranged election lies.”\\nThose italics are in the lawsuit, apparently seeking to highlight the defamatory sting of Tapper’s remarks. Except they are no such thing. It’s well established that Trump has been told, again and again, that his claims about a stolen election are false. His persistence in airing these claims suggests that he’s lying, though Trump’s lawyers have said that he “subjectively believes that the results of the 2020 presidential election turned on fraudulent voting activity in several key states.”\\nAdvertisement\\nEven if Trump believed his own statements, however, Tapper’s commentary would be protected as hyperbole — a valued commodity in a democratic society.\\nCNN’s lawyers will also likely argue that the challenged statements in the suit are, to a large extent, protected as assertions of opinion — the very doctrine that Trump deployed to get out of a lawsuit brought by a Republican strategist in 2016.\\nThe complaint also argues that CNN has treated Trump’s claims of a stolen election differently from various claims by Democrats in recent election cycles. Set aside for a moment the fact that Trump’s claims have been more persistent, more egregious and more impactful, as we all saw at the Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2021. Even if CNN had treated Democratic claims of voter fraud more favorably, that would be protected First Amendment activity. Just think what would happen to Fox News if slanted reporting amounted to libel.\\nAdvertisement\\n· Licht held a conference call in June 2022 in which he expressed low regard for the wording “big lie,” a term with Nazi origins. “Since then,” reads the complaint, “CNN’s on-air personalities — including John King, Jake Tapper, John Avlon, Brianna Keilar, and Don Lemon, among others — have continued to use the phrase in describing [Trump and Trump’s] questions of election integrity despite an apparent admonition from their Chief Executive Officer.”\\nSo what? This is a management issue for CNN, not a legal one.\\nCalling presidents liars, even when they’re honest, is a great American tradition.

Offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all.”\\n“That said, having to ban an account has real and significant ramifications. While there are clear and obvious exceptions, I feel a ban is a failure of ours ultimately to promote healthy conversation.

They limit the potential for clarification, redemption, and learning. And sets a precedent I feel is dangerous: the power an individual or corporation has over a part of the global public conversation.”\\nDorsey claimed that the company did not coordinate with other tech companies with its decision to ban the president and that other companies either made their own choices or “were emboldened by the actions of others.”\\n“This moment in time might call for this dynamic, but over the long term it will be destructive to the noble purpose and ideals of the open internet. A company making a business decision to moderate itself is different from a government removing access, yet can feel much the same,” he said. “Yes, we all need to look critically at inconsistencies of our policy and enforcement. Yes, we need to look at how our service might incentivize distraction and harm. Yes, we need more transparency in our moderation operations.

The announcement came as Congress readied legislation that would devote $1.375 billion to the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump demanded.\\nDeclaring an emergency would let Trump sidestep Democratic opposition to more wall funding, but it could draw legal challenges from lawmakers and others who viewed the move as a power grab. Although that could delay construction of his border barriers, an extended legal battle would give Trump a potent political issue to run on in the 2020 presidential election.\\n\"Everyone’s going to come out of the woodwork,\" said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas-Austin law professor who teaches national security law. \"I think we’re going to see an array of lawsuits that actually would all have to be dealt with separately.\"\\nMcConnell: Trump to sign bill, declare emergency Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says President Donald Trump has indicated he\\'s prepared to sign the government funding bill to avert another government shutdown and issue a national emergency on the border at the same time.

The president, who faced criticism from some Republicans for the idea, said he wouldn\\'t declare an emergency imminently. Republicans noted a future Democratic president could also use an emergency to work around Congress.\\nLitigation could go all the way to the Supreme Court, which has smacked down attempts by both Trump and President Barack Obama to make end runs around Congress. How long that takes would depend on several factors:\\n• Which programs the White House might try to tap for funding.\\n• Whether Trump tries to speed the seizure of property from unwilling owners.\\n• Who could be harmed by the order and would have the right to sue.\\n• What court or courts are chosen by challengers seeking favorable verdicts.\\nFor weeks, Trump weighed invoking a national emergency as the political impasse over the wall led to a partial government shutdown that became the longest in U.S. history. White House aides acknowledged that lawyers reviewed the ramifications.\\nThe president expressed confidence in the legal strategy. \"The law is 100 percent on my side,\" he said.\\nDemocrats blasted the move. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer called the decision a \"gross abuse of the power of the presidency\" in a joint statement.\\nLegal experts differed over how much latitude Trump would have to free up money for the wall on his own. They cautioned that those who favor an emergency declaration may trade a deadlock in Congress for a lengthy legal fight in the federal judiciary.\\nWalter Dellinger, an assistant attorney general and head of the Office of Legal Counsel under President Bill Clinton, said a lawsuit could reach the Supreme Court in a matter of months but probably would not be resolved quickly.\\n“I think that a clear majority of the Supreme Court will be deeply troubled by the invocation of emergency authority in this case,” Dellinger said. \"In the normal course, we might not expect a decision until June of 2020 at the earliest.\"\\nPresidents have broad authority to declare an emergency but are more restricted in how they can use it. White House officials zeroed in on provisions that would let Trump capture unused money Congress set aside for other purposes.\\n“None of these statutes is a blank check,\" Vladeck said.\\nAnother question that would have to be decided early in the process: Who has the right to sue?

David Perdue (R) and Kelly Loeffler (R) ahead of the January runoff.\\nSen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said “the president and vice president will have a lot of capital” with the base and could be key to turning out Republican voters in Georgia.\\nAl Cross, a professor at the University of Kentucky and a longtime observer of Kentucky politics, said Biden was correct Tuesday when he said Republicans are “mildly intimidated” by Trump.\\nCross said McConnell “has to worry about Trump messing up what they’re trying to do in Georgia, messing up what they might try to do in the next Congress, messing up the next election, messing up the party.”\\nOther political observers have gone a step further, warning that Trump is inflicting lasting damage on American democracy with his claims of a stolen election.\\nSenate Republicans, however, are largely aligning themselves with Trump’s position on the election results. Only four GOP senators have extended congratulations to President-elect Joe Biden.\\nBetween now and Inauguration Day, McConnell will need Trump’s support to pass a year-end omnibus spending bill and a targeted coronavirus relief package, two of his top priorities for the lame-duck session — something that is far from guaranteed.

Davis claims that the recording clearly shows Trump proposing the idea of paying “cash,” while Giuliani continues to dispute this.\\nFirst, in our opinion as prosecutors who have spent hundreds of hours painstakingly scrutinizing similar recordings, it does sound like Trump is the one who proposed paying cash. Beyond that, it is entirely clear that Cohen and Trump agreed on the need to set up a shell company to make the payment, as the Wall Street Journal reported Cohen in fact formed. So, Mr. Giuliani, why set up a shell company to make the payment if there was nothing to hide? Why not just make the payment directly from Donald Trump or the Trump campaign?\\nLooking at the bigger picture, there is much more here than just a dispute about who says “cash” and who says “check.” From a prosecutor’s perspective, this recording is crucial evidence that could add significantly to the strength of potential felony charges.\\n“ Why set up a shell company to make the payment if there was nothing to hide? Why not just make the payment directly from Donald Trump or the Trump campaign? ”\\nWhile there is some debate about whether Trump could be indicted directly or whether impeachment is the sole consequence for his conduct (an issue that almost certainly would need to be resolved by the Supreme Court), his conduct on the tape could support criminal liability for campaign finance violations, bank fraud, wire or mail fraud, and tax evasion. Even if Trump himself did not commit all of these offenses, or even if the crimes never actually occurred, he could be liable for conspiracy because he agreed with others (including Cohen) to commit these acts. Taken as a whole, the recording shows that Trump—despite his prior statements to the contrary—was part of an ongoing scheme to pay AMI to silence McDougal in the weeks before the election. Trump can’t deny it now: He knew about and endorsed the scheme, according to the tape.\\nThe tape also reveals that the true purpose behind the proposed McDougal payment was to ensure her silence in the weeks leading up to the election. Former Senator John Edwards was charged in a similar scheme but was acquitted because the government could not adequately show that the purpose of payments to his former mistress was to affect the 2008 primary election, as opposed to hiding the affair from his wife. This tape shows that Trump’s purpose unequivocally was to protect himself electorally. On the tape, Trump and Cohen talk about poll numbers, less than two months before the election, and Trump talks about delaying the unsealing of divorce records until, implicitly, after the election.\\nKeep in mind that prosecutors would never rely on this tape standing alone to prove guilt. It would be one brick in a foundation made up of many different parts. That’s how prosecutors build criminal cases—layer upon layer of overlapping, corroborating evidence. Here, the recording would be used in conjunction with financial records, emails, and witness testimony, including, perhaps, from Cohen himself.\\nIf Cohen cooperates, which he has signaled he wants to do, he can guide the prosecutors though every nuance of this tape and countless other pieces of evidence. After working for Trump for over a decade, Cohen could be the prosecutor’s dream cooperator: one who had special insider access to the leader of a powerful, closed, corrupt organization. We used to prosecute mafia cases. We both know that in the mob—and, perhaps in this White House—the right cooperator can bring down the entire hierarchy. We both have made cases based largely on the testimony of cooperating witnesses with insider access that took down leaders of the Gambino and Genovese crime families in New York.\\nThat scenario is still quite a ways off in this case, but the new tape is one indication that Cohen just might be in position to make it happen.\\nMiriam Rocah was an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York from 2001 to 2017 and is a Distinguished Criminal Justice Fellow at the Elisabeth Haub School of Law at Pace University.

His Writing Has Appeared In The Wall Street Journal, The Claremont Review Of Books, The New York Post, Elsewhere. Follow Him On Twitter', datetime.datetime(2022, 1, 4, 11, 30), 'A lengthy New York Times editorial over the weekend has set the stage for this week’s Jan. 6 anniversary coverage. “Every Day Is Jan. 6 Now,” declare the Times editors, warning that Republican lawmakers in 41 states “have been trying to advance the goals of the Jan. 6 rioters — not by breaking laws but by making them.”\\nThe argument itself, that tweaking state election law is somehow a subversion of democracy, is absurd and incredibly lazy. But it’s important to note, if only because it will serve as the baseline narrative for the entire corporate media’s Jan. 6 coverage this week.\\nTheir message — they will all have more or less the same message — is simple: all Republicans are insurrectionists, the GOP is the enemy of the people, and the only way to preserve American democracy is to ensure that only Democrats can win elections.\\nTo make this case, the Times’ editors had to stage a kind of linguistic insurrection. Lawful, constitutional efforts by elected representatives to change state election laws amount, in the Times’ telling, to a “bloodless, legalized” insurrection that “that no police officer can arrest and that no prosecutor can try in court.”\\nThat’s no different than saying “speech is violence.” It’s nonsensical. By definition, there’s no such thing as a “bloodless, legalized” insurrection, any more than there could be a “mostly peaceful” riot. That said, the Times editors are wrong about one thing: state laws, including state election laws, can and often are challenged in court.\\nBut the nonsense here serves a purpose. If the Jan. 6 riot can be conflated with perfectly valid GOP-led efforts to shore up state election rules, then perhaps those efforts can be wholly undermined, regardless of what voters in red states want. The irony is that it isn’t GOP lawmakers trying “to wrest control of electoral votes from their own people,” as the Times editors charge; it’s the Democrats and their media allies.\\nConsider that last year, 44 states enacted some 285 bills related to elections. In blue states, those bills tended to loosen certain election rules and requirements, especially for mail-in and absentee ballots. That makes sense given that Democrats tend to vote by mail-in ballot far more often than Republicans. Making mail-in and absentee voting easier is merely a way to boost Democratic votes in any given state. It’s simple.\\nBy contrast, Republican-led states tended to pass laws limiting or more strictly defining the rules for mail-in and absentee voting, on the theory that absentee balloting is inherently less secure and more susceptible to fraud, especially when paired, as it often is, with practices like ballot-harvesting.\\nRepublican lawmakers’ motivation here was to prevent a repeat of the free-for-all of the 2020 election, which saw a raft of last-minute changes to mail-in and absentee voting rules, justified on account of the pandemic. Many Republicans rightly felt that judges who overruled state legislatures and re-wrote state elections laws by fiat (as happened in Pennsylvania), undermined the integrity of the election.\\nBy passing such reforms, Republican lawmakers were responding to actions taken by Democrats, unelected public health officials, and Democrat-friendly judges to overhaul state election rules ahead of 2020. If you wanted to be disingenuous about it, you could argue that Democrats staged a “bloodless, legalized” insurrection before the 2020 election even took place.\\nThat’s why the Times and the rest of the corporate press want so badly to talk about Jan. 6 instead of getting into the nitty gritty of what these Republican-passed election reforms actually do. You’ll notice the media always describe these laws as “restricting voter access,” even when they do no such thing. The entire conversation is a bit of legerdemain, nothing more. That’s why you’ll never read a piece in the corporate press about how Georgia’s new election law, which President Joe Biden called “Jim Crow on steroids,” actually makes voting easier than it is in Biden’s home state of Delaware.\\nRemember that when you read breathless remembrances of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol this week. Yes, the riot was bad and should have been put down with overwhelming force — just as the riots all throughout the summer and fall of 2020 should have been.\\nBut the actions of a relatively small group of rioters that day have absolutely nothing to do with the perfectly valid efforts of GOP lawmakers to ensure that election rules are not changed at the last minute by unelected judges or public health officials. Equating the two, pretending they share a common cause and motivation, is a way to discredit the valid arguments of Republicans, smear them as “insurrectionists,” and eventually justify efforts to silence them.\\nJohn Daniel Davidson is a senior editor at The Federalist.

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). “It would be a huge loss if Barr left. I think he’s been a fantastic attorney general.”\\nPeople close to Barr and Trump said Barr’s concerns were genuine but did not signal an imminent blowup.\\n“There is some tension. The tension has been public. Bill hasn’t hidden what his concern is,” said one person familiar with their interactions. “They’ve both been public about it. I think they still a have a very good relationship.”\\nThe source also dismissed the notion that the attorney general is on the verge of quitting.\\n“I can imagine a circumstance where he said, ‘I’m not dealing with this. I may resign.’ That may be a general conversation that was misinterpreted,” said the Barr ally. “Barr is not hiding the fact it’s difficult for him. But it doesn’t mean he’s leaving.”\\nOne former senior administration official said the media reports about Barr’s resignation threat looks more like it was done “to try to create a rift” between his attorney general and the president.\\n“I just can’t think a guy in my mind as savvy as Barr, that he’d actually tell people that,” said the former official. “I have a hard time believing that’s what happening. That’s tempting fate. Now you’re going to get the president pissed off and he’s going to say, ‘You know what? Fire him.’”\\nStill, one sign that Barr is genuinely distressed is the joint statement of support GOP congressional leaders suddenly issued for the attorney general Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham all saluted Barr as “a man of the highest character and unquestionable integrity.”\\nThe statement came as a petition by former Justice Department officials calling on Barr to resign surpassed 2,000 signatures.\\nAt Barr’s only public event Wednesday, he got a vote of confidence from FBI Director Christopher Wray, even through the two men offered notably different takes on the recent inspector general report on surveillance abuses — with Barr striking a more Trump-friendly stance.\\n“He is no stranger to tackling challenges,” Wray said of Barr, calling him “my friend” and noting his long history at DOJ, including his prior stint as attorney general three decades ago. “We need that type of strong leadership.”\\nBarr continued to build common cause with the U.S. national security establishment by joining in an op-ed released Wednesday warning about the threat of foreign interference in the 2020 election. The topic is known to be one whose mere mention irritates the president, but the piece soft-pedaled the part most galling to Trump, making just one passing reference to Russia.\\nFor now, the guessing game inside and outside the Justice Department is just how much interference and commentary from the president Barr will stomach before moving on.\\nBarr has built up a thick skin during his two stints as attorney, so no one expects him to resign because Trump tweeted some unkind videos from Fox Business News. But worrisome for Barr is that one of Trump’s retweets Wednesday highlighted past presidents’ efforts to influence Justice Department investigations.\\nBarr’s effectiveness is now directly tied to the intensity of Trump’s focus on his DOJ-related grievances. If there are many days when the president obsesses about them publicly, the attorney general’s tenure may be limited.\\nOn the other hand, Trump is eminently distractable and sometimes seems more interested in whacking the Democratic presidential candidates than going after the deep state.\\nAs Trump’s political schedule ramps up in the coming months, the chief risk for Barr may be that the president decides to make railing against prosecutors, judges and even jurors a staple of his campaign stump speech, delving into the topic again and again.\\nBut to really put the attorney general in an excruciating fix, those attacks would have to coincide with Barr’s efforts to exert control over the department — a perfect storm that occurred last week, but that might not be whipped up to the same degree again before the election.\\n“People at the Justice Department will tolerate the attorney general getting involved in their cases for legitimate reasons,” said Miller, the former Holder aide. “The AG has the right to do that. They’ll even tolerate it if there’s some deniability of a political motive, but when the president removes any plausible deniability, there’s nothing for the career employees to do but revolt to keep their own integrity intact.”'], 'https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/09/trump-is-already-fundraising-off-impeachment/': ['motherjones.com', 'Trump Is Already Fundraising Off Impeachment', 'Russ Choma, Abigail Weinberg, Arianna Coghill, David Corn, Pema Levy, James West, Ali Breland, Oliver Milman, Angelica Cabral, Samantha Michaels', datetime.datetime(2019, 9, 24, 16, 57, 32), 'Fight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters.\\nDonald Trump’s reelection campaign wasted no time trying to capitalize on the Democratic push for impeachment, blasting out a fundraising email Tuesday afternoon urging supporters to help defend the president by donating to his campaign. The email contained several dubious promises, including the claim that immediate contributions would result in donors being added to an “Official Impeachment Defense Task Force.” The email also stated that donations would be “double matched”—which is unlikely to be true, due to federal campaign finance laws that impose strict limits on political donations.\\nThe number of Democrats calling for impeachment has risen gradually over the summer, but as recently as last week this step was still opposed by the Democratic Party leadership. Following revelations that Trump pressed Ukraine’s president to investigate discredited allegations against Joe Biden and withheld military aid from the country to ramp up pressure, dozens of Democratic lawmakers joined the call to begin impeachment proceedings. Ahead of a 5 p.m. press conference Tuesday afternoon, at which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to publicly call for an impeachment inquiry, the Trump campaign fired off its fundraising pitch:\\nThese Impeachment claims have nothing to do with the President – the Democrats thrive on silencing and intimidating his supporters, like YOU. They want to take YOUR VOTE away. We won’t stand for this any longer, and neither should YOU. Which is why President Trump is launching the Official Impeachment Defense Task Force. This task force will be made up of only President Trump’s most LOYAL supporters, the ones committed to fighting for him, re-electing him, and taking back the House.\\nThe email also suggested that by donating to the campaign supporters would be defending the very integrity of America:\\nAs a member of the Official Impeachment Defense Task Force, you will be a leader in defending the President against these baseless and disgusting attacks. You will be responsible for defending American Greatness. The future of American freedom rests on the shoulders of men and women willing to defend it from these hateful attacks, and today is a day for action.\\nThe fundraising appeal claimed that Trump had personally requested to see a list of people who had joined his “Official Impeachment Defense Task Force” and urged donors to send their money before 3:30 p.m., when the list would supposedly be sent to the president. Shortly after the deadline passed, Trump’s campaign sent a nearly identical email, this one saying the deadline was 4 p.m.\\nCampaigns have fairly wide latitude to make promises in campaign fundraising emails, so Team Trump’s claims of an official “Task Force” or that Trump would personally review the names of donors don’t have to be true. Another suspect claim: the email’s pledge that donations would be “double-matched.”\\nDonor match programs are common in the nonprofit fundraising world and are considered to be highly effective in encouraging donors who might be on the fence about giving. In the nonprofit world, a match program typically involves a one or several particularly generous donors, who are poised to write big checks if smaller donors start giving. However, in the political sphere, federal campaign finance laws make things a little more complicated, since individual donors are legally capped at giving no more than $5,400 to a campaign per election cycle. That means a single generous donor can’t match new small donations. If a campaign wants to raise money on any large scale, even a handful of generous matching donors won’t work—hundreds or thousands would be necessary. It’s unlikely that would really happen.\\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to questions about its “Official Impeachment Defense Task Force,” how many donors had joined, or how it planned to “double-match” their contributions.\\nListen to Mother Jones Washington Bureau Chief David Corn explain what happens next, in this special impeachment edition of the Mother Jones Podcast:'], 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-shutdown-stunt-is-an-act-of-needless-stupidity/2018/12/21/5567582c-0551-11e9-b6a9-0aa5c2fcc9e4_story.html?noredirect=on': ['washingtonpost.com', 'Opinion | Trump’s shutdown stunt is an act of needless stupidity', 'Editorial Board', datetime.datetime(2018, 12, 22, 1, 7, 56), \"This stalemate is just the latest in a long line of threats from President Trump to shut down the government if he doesn't get his way.

Circuit Court, often thought of as the second most powerful court in the country. Prior to that, Kavanaugh worked for the Office of the Independent Counsel under Ken Starr. There, he headed up the probe into the suicide of longtime Bill Clinton attorney and friend Vince Foster and eventually helped write the Starr Report about President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.\\n“Judge Kavanaugh has impeccable credentials, unsurpassed qualifications, and a proven commitment to equal justice under the law,” Trump said during a prime-time address at the White House.\\nThat much is true. There is no question that Kavanaugh is highly qualified and widely respected. In addition to serving as a judge, Kavanaugh teaches at both Harvard and Yale law schools. (Well-known liberal professor at Yale, Akhil Amar, published “A Liberal’s Case for Brett Kavanaugh” in the New York Times after the announcement.) His ethical reputation is impeccable.\\nBut while Kavanaugh’s record on women’s and LGBT rights is sparse, it gives good reason to suspect that he could be the swing vote to strike down Roe v. Wade, the abortion-rights case. This, after all, is what Trump promised in 2016: that Roe would be “automatically” be overturned should he be elected. And Kavanaugh has been praised by numerous right-wing organizations.\\nIn the case of Garza v. Hargan, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals held that an undocumented teenage immigrant was entitled to obtain an abortion without having to obtain familial consent (as is required in several states).\\nKavanaugh vigorously dissented, asking, “Is it really absurd for the United States to think that the minor should be transferred to her immigration sponsor ― ordinarily a family member, relative, or friend ― before she makes that decision?”\\nThose are strong words, endorsing not only parental consent rules but enforcing them in extreme circumstances. If you are looking for signals that a Justice Kavanaugh would limit or overturn Roe, Garza is a giant red flare.\\nSurprisingly, however, Kavanaugh may not be conservative enough to survive the confirmation process. There is even talk that conservatives might revolt against Kavanaugh, as they did in 2005 against George W. Bush’s nomination of Harriet Miers. The reason? Many conservatives wanted Kavanaugh to cast doubt on the teenager’s right to get an abortion at all, which another dissenting judge did.\\nLegally speaking, that objection is absurd. Not unlike “judicial minimalist” Chief Justice John Roberts, Kavanaugh was discussing the case at issue, not some hypothetical issue. And he was responding to the circuit court’s holding, not writing an essay.\\nBut there’s more. Some conservatives have pointed to dicta in another Kavanaugh opinion, a dissent in Priests for Life v. HHS, a case similar to Hobby Lobby involving the Affordable Care Act’s contraception requirement. While dissenting in favor of the Catholic religious organization objecting to the requirement, Kavanaugh wrote that the “the Government has a compelling interest in facilitating women’s access to contraception” because of a variety of factors, such as “reducing the number of unintended pregnancies would further women’s health, advance women’s personal and professional opportunities, reduce the number of abortions, and help break a cycle of poverty.”\\nKavanaugh is writing here about the state’s interest in access to contraception, not whether an individual has a constitutional right to access it. Those are totally different questions. But Kavanaugh’s opinion doesn’t question the constitutional right either, which rests on the same foundations (substantive due process, privacy, family) as the right to obtain an abortion. It is reasonable to wonder whether Judge Kavanaugh’s dicta in Priests for Life suggests more flexibility on contraception and abortion than hard-right conservatives would like.\\nPolitically, however, it might be enough to tar Kavanaugh with the “soft on abortion” label in the right-wing echo chamber, and all it takes is a single Republican senator to doom his nomination, assuming no Democrats cross the aisle. Already, the Democrats’ leader in the Senate, Charles Schumer, said he would oppose Kavanaugh.\\nAs for LGBT issues, Kavanaugh’s record is thin, but enough to worry LGBT activists, who fear he will limit or overturn gay people’s constitutional right to marriage. In a case anticipating the Supreme Court’s Hobby Lobby case, Kavanaugh held that the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that qualified insurance plans include contraception coverage violated the religious freedom of employers.\\nThat is the same logic that was at issue in last month’s Masterpiece Cakeshop case before the Supreme Court, which pitted the rights of LGBT people to be free from discrimination against a bakery owner’s rights to religious freedom. (The court ruled in favor of the owner on a technicality.)\\nMoreover, despite the misgivings of some conservatives, Kavanaugh was vetted by the Federalist Society and its de facto leader Leonard Leo. It is highly unlikely that the Federalist Society would approve a judicial candidate who didn’t toe the line on overturning Roe, and Obergefell v. Hodges, the same-sex marriage case.\\nWhile the Federalist Society can ask Judge Kavanaugh about his views privately and get a straight answer, it’s a certainty that when Congress asks, he will chant the mantras of “I will apply the law fairly and respect precedent” and “I can’t comment on any hypothetical case.”\\nThat’s just like what Trump said in nominating Kavanaugh.\\n“In keeping with President Reagan’s legacy, I do not ask about a nominee’s personal opinions,” he said. “What matters is not a judge’s political views but whether they can set aside those views to do what the law and the constitution require. I am pleased to say that I have found, without doubt, such a person.”\\nIn contrast, the Federalist Society’s Leonard Leo said following the nomination that \"Brett Kavanaugh is among the most distinguished and respected judges in the country, with nearly 300 opinions that clearly demonstrate fairness and a commitment to interpreting the Constitution as it’s written, and enforcing the limits on government power contained in the Constitution.”\\nUnlike what Trump said, Leo’s statement is a dog-whistle to conservatives. “Interpreting the Constitution as it’s written” means that substantive due process, the doctrine underneath Roe, Obergefell —and even Griswold v. Connecticut, which forbids the government from banning contraception — is illegitimate. That means all those cases are on the chopping block.\\nAnd “enforcing the limits on government power” means curbing the power government agencies. Here, Kavanaugh’s record is crystal clear: he has voted to overturn several EPA decisions; sided with conservatives on net neutrality, holding that the Obama-era FCC exceeded its authority; and said in 2016 that the entire Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is unconstitutional.\\n“ ‘Interpreting the Constitution as it’s written’ means that substantive due process, the doctrine underneath Roe, Obergefell — and even Griswold v. Connecticut, which forbids the government from banning contraception — is illegitimate. ”\\nKavanaugh may be a relatively blank slate on abortion and LGBT equality, but the slate is covered with chalk when it comes to environmental, health, safety, and consumer protection regulations.\\nEarthjustice President Trip Van Noppen noted that “in one decision—later reversed by the Supreme Court—he blocked an Environmental Protection Agency rule that would limit dangerous interstate air pollution from power plants. In another case, he barred people who regularly drive on highways from suing to secure stronger car and truck safety standards.”\\nWhat’s most surprising about Trump picking Kavanaugh, though, are Kavanaugh’s stated views on presidents defending themselves against criminal investigations while in office.\\nAfter his stint working for Starr, Kavanaugh wrote in the Minnesota Law Review, that Congress should consider passing a law exempting the president civil and “criminal prosecution and investigation” while they are in office.\\nThat may seem like Trump’s most fervent wish, and it has been interpreted that way by some left-leaning commentators. Actually, however, Kavanaugh’s reasoning cuts the other way, and poses a real risk for Trump.\\n“Having seen first-hand how complex and difficult that job is, I believe it vital that the President be able to focus on his never-ending tasks with as few distractions as possible,” Kavanaugh wrote. “The country wants the President to be ‘one of us’ who bears the same responsibilities of citizenship that all share. But I believe that the President should be excused from some of the burdens of ordinary citizenship while serving in office.”\\nIn other words, it’s impossible to function as both the subject of a criminal investigation and the president of the United States. Moreover, Kavanaugh said, impeachment is the appropriate process for such matters.\\nIt remains to be seen whether Kavanaugh will sail through his confirmation process, or be opposed by the right, or be opposed by a handful of moderates siding with the Democratic opposition.\\nPerhaps anticipating some of the criticism of Kavanaugh, American Conservative Union President Matt Schlapp (who, like Kavanaugh, is former Bush 43 administration official) wrote in The Hill that “Too many times, conservatives have been burned by Supreme Court nominees who lack a judicial record that demonstrates their approach.”\\nYet Schapp distinguished Kavanaugh from such past candidates, saying “Judge Kavanaugh has consistently, boldly, and fearlessly applied textualism and originalism to a striking range of legal issues.”\\nThat is exactly what advocates women’s and LGBT rights fear.'], 'https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/Politics-Watch/2019/0717/Scuffle-over-Trump-s-racist-tweet-reflects-shifting-views-among-parties': ['csmonitor.com', \"Scuffle over Trump's 'racist' tweet reflects shifting views among parties\", 'The Christian Science Monitor, Liz Marlantes', datetime.datetime(2019, 7, 17, 16, 39), \"Dear reader:\\nIt is against the rules of the House of Representatives to call the president of the United States a racist.\\nOr rather, it’s a violation of a “precedential ruling of the chair,” based on guidelines laid out by Thomas Jefferson, which have evolved over time to read that “personal abuse, innuendo, or ridicule of the president is not permitted.”\\nWhy We Wrote This To the left, calling out racism is a step toward eradicating the problem.

You’re a racist. Donald Trump’s a racist. Nancy Pelosi was a racist until she attacked Trump for racism,” writes Trump supporter Roger L. Simon in PJ Media. Such condemnation, he adds, “only makes people hate each other. It creates racism rather than solves it.”\\nGet stories that\\nempower and uplift daily.

She’d never voted before Donald Trump ran for president. She traveled to the capital because she loves the president.\\nNot long after our conversation, hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol. They climbed the walls, pushed past police, and roamed the halls, destroying property and taking selfies. A 14-year Air Force veteran did not leave the building alive. It was a disgraceful sight.\\nThere are those who believe Antifa showed up to incite chaos. It’s possible such an attempt was made, but even if it was, there is simply no way around the fact that hundreds of Trump supporters broke into the Capitol.\\nThousands more chose not to participate, leaving early or watching from a distance. From my vantage point on the east side of the Capitol, I saw genuine Trump supporters rushing up a staircase by the dozens, until the crowd was too dense to move. I saw a few urinate on trees just outside the building, barely shielded from women in the crowd.\\nI saw them climbing up the wall. Some chanted “Whose house? Our house.” Some chanted, “Do your job!” Antifa may have mixed into the fray, but to accurately diagnose this deep wound, it’s important to be crystal clear that Trump supporters rioted. Indeed, many were proud to do it. If you’d rather not take my word for it, there is incontrovertible video evidence.\\n“I’ve been out talking to the protesters who busted into the Capitol,” Washington Examiner reporter Susan Ferrechio tweeted. “One thing I’m hearing: They believed they had a right to be in a public building and did not expect cops to block their access (some were allowed in!) A subset of this group, they said, got out of control.”\\nAnd so the blame game rages on. Rioting is the fault of rioters. But they had just been told by the president that a “landslide” election was being stolen from him.\\nMany people trust Donald Trump. They have been lied to by the media for years. They have been smeared as racists by elites and peers alike. With no other sources to turn to, they turn to the man who seems to hear them. He took advantage of that to lessen the blow of a narrow reelection loss.\\nLove him or hate him, it turns out Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., was right last week when he argued “[t]he president and his allies are playing with fire.” No senator believes Donald Trump defeated Joe Biden in a “landslide.” Many do, however, believe (and with good reason) that election irregularities occurred on a wider-than-acceptable scale.\\nThe people I spoke to today, most of whom were at a total loss for who to trust in the media, believe the president. He told them a “landslide” win was being stolen. That would be a crisis. They acted as such. What did he expect?\\nFor years now, Republicans have been pressed daily to strike a delicate balance, ignoring bad tweets to maintain a working relationship with a president beloved by many of their constituents. They had a reasonable argument for doing that. It pushed them to be more responsive to disenfranchised working-class voters. It gave them a seat at the table. But in the waning days of Trump’s tenure, one of the worst-case scenarios of a loose-lipped president came to pass.\\nSome lawmakers and pundits will use it as an excuse to be more openly critical. Reasonable Conservatives will trip over themselves to prove their reasonableness. Some will continue with their fealty and others will pretend they never did.\\nThis is not vindication for the pundits who warned repeatedly Trump’s rhetoric was dangerous. Far from it. First, many conservatives who support his policy agenda abhor his rhetoric and say as much. Some downplay it to avoid making negotiations impossible.\\nBut more than anything, it’s not vindication because such pundits harbor contempt for many of their decent, patriotic neighbors. They also excuse similar behavior on the left time and again. That, of course, does not vindicate anyone who stormed or cheered the storming of the Capitol either.\\nOur elites are corrupt. The political establishment is not serving us well. These wounds will not be healed by sanctimonious Instagram posts, cable news monologues, egghead Twitter threads, or lofty speeches on the Senate floor, applauded by Beltway journalists who just pocketed $2,000 bonuses and rarely worry about feeding their families.\\nIn a sense, Wednesday will end in the same way it started, under a president known to be a flawed messenger for a deeply upset constituency.\\nThe woman from Wisconsin who was kind enough to share her thoughts with me as she marched through the city volunteered that even she, a Trump diehard who traveled across the country for a midweek rally, wasn’t always happy with everything he said. But like everyone else with whom I spoke, she eagerly insisted she would follow Trump straight into a third party.\\nIt is the fault of the political class that Trump—or Bernie Sanders—feel like the only viable solutions to so many Americans. The Capitol riot will hurt the people who were already hurting most, the decent rally goers at a loss for answers, continually ignored and smeared, saddled with the baggage of violence they did not commit.\\nAs the Capitol devolved into chaos, I overheard a protester walking away from the scene, down the hill on the east side Union Station, mutter about the political establishment to his friend. “It’s like they’re playing a game,” he sighed, “and everyone has a role to play but us.”\\nEmily Jashinsky is culture editor at The Federalist and host of Federalist Radio Hour.

The Tweeter-in-Chief even squeezed in a few compliments for the digital allies arrayed before him, many of whom have achieved viral fame by peddling conspiracies or far-right outrage.\\nAdvertisement\\n“Some of you are extraordinary,” he said. “Not all of you. But some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable.”\\nThe White House did not invite the big social media companies to its event on purported bias against conservatives. There was no constructive conversation around the many and varied problems of social media to be had on Thursday. The public portion of the much-publicized event instead resembled a live reenactment of one of Trump’s early-morning tweetstorms.\\nWith a captive audience crammed into the East Room of the White House, the president took the opportunity to bash tech companies, highlight his poll numbers, personally commend Project Veritas provocateur James O’Keefe, mistakenly say that Arnold Schwarzenegger is dead while referencing a canceled TV show, and — like any good Twitter user — complain that he’s not getting retweets like he used to.\\n“When I put out something, a good one that people like, right? A good tweet. It goes up,” Trump said. “It used to go up, it would say: 7,000; 7,008; 7,017; 7,024; 7,032; 7,044. Right? Now it goes: 7,000; 7,008; 6,998. Then they go: 7,009; 6,074. I said, what’s going on? It never did that before. It goes up, and then they take it down. Then it goes up. I never had it. Does anyone know what I’m talking about with this?”\\nNumerous voices in the crowd responded: Yes!\\nAdvertisement\\nIn an event billed as a free-speech fest, Trump also made sure to differentiate between his supporters’ ability to say whatever they wished online and the press’ right to cover him critically.\\n“It’s so crooked. It’s so dishonest,” he said. “Free speech is not when you see something good and write bad. You become angry at it. It’s not good.”\\nEarlier in the day, reporters shared images of props that had been distributed throughout the summit venue, including signs with phonetically spelled buzzwords associated with social media. For example: “SHADOW BANNING, shad-oh ban-ing, verb: The subjective hiding or demotion of a social media user’s visibility, typically in search results.”\\nTrump hammered the point home in his free-associative remarks afterward, zeroing in on a favorite refrain among conservatives.\\n“Shadowban. Hundred percent. If you look at what’s going on,” he said. “The blocking, the basic blocking of what we want to get out! The fact they don’t let them join,” said Trump, gesturing at the assortment of internet trolls, MAGA provocateurs, and his eldest son sitting before him. “I should have millions and millions. I would have so many millions you wouldn’t believe it. But they’ve been blocked! I have people say, ‘sir, I can’t find you.” They make it impossible! They can’t find me!”\\nAdvertisement\\nHe went on to extol the virtues of quick, dirty diplomacy via social media. For example, Trump asserted that the complex issue of Israel’s Golan Heights — the subject of political meetings and summits for 50 years — was, in fact, fixed by a tweet he fired off during a visit.\\n“They fly in, they fly out,” Trump said, referring to his predecessors. “Some had beautiful planes, some didn’t. Some didn’t get there by plane.”\\nNot Trump, thanks to his 280-character megaphone.\\n“I talked about it very quickly,” Trump said. “I press it. In two seconds, we have breaking news. Now that’s Twitter. That’s social media. I call Twitter a typewriter. Because it goes onto Facebook automatically. It goes onto Instagram. It goes onto television. More to Fox than CNN.”\\nAdding to the conspiratorial framing of the summit, Twitter — Trump’s platform of choice — went dark just as the event was slated to begin. And a reporter from the pro-Trump conspiracy site Infowars was live-streaming just steps away from the White House as it all went down. Was it just a coincidence, Millie Weaver asked interviewees?\\n“The initial salvo of the digital war just started,” an unidentified man responded. “Mark my words.”\\nInfowars sits on the crazier fringe of the pro-Trump internet. But its assumptions around a momentary outage point to many of his digital media allies’ thought processes.\\n“You can’t try to shadow-ban all of us all at once,” Weaver said to the camera. “The only way they can try to kill #SocialMediaSummit and the cries from conservatives to crack down on Twitter is to kill social media. Think of it: Twitter has a motive as to why they wouldn’t want the Social Media Summit to go viral. These are all conservatives that have a case against them.”\\n“This cannot be a coincidence,” she added. “This is trying to ruin the effect that the Social Media Summit could possibly have through this social media hemisphere.”'], 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sondlands-bombshell-testimony-leaves-trumps-republican-allies-scrambling/2019/11/20/bf8e54f8-0bbd-11ea-97ac-a7ccc8dd1ebc_story.html': ['washingtonpost.com', 'Sondland’s bombshell testimony leaves Trump’s Republican allies scrambling', 'Seung Min Kim, Josh Dawsey, Kayla Epstein', datetime.datetime(2019, 11, 21, 1, 28, 33), 'U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland undercut at least nine different Republican defenses of President Trump’s actions on Ukraine on Nov. 20. (Video: JM Rieger/The Washington Post)\\nComment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\\nThe White House and President Trump’s allies scrambled on Wednesday to contain the damage from new allegations from Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, whose testimony in front of impeachment investigators detailed an explicit “quid pro quo” with Ukraine at Trump’s ultimate directive. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The bombshell testimony from Sondland alleging that the president attempted to leverage an invite for Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky in exchange for an investigation into his political opponents forced the White House, which was not aware of his testimony in advance, to quickly recalibrate its defense of the president’s actions.\\nAdministration officials immediately sought to emphasize that Sondland was relying in part on his own presumptions based on conversations with Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani — an argument echoed by GOP lawmakers later Wednesday — and that Trump himself never personally told Sondland about preconditioning $400 million in military aid to Ukraine or a coveted White House visit on the probes.\\nAdvertisement\\nU.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland said there was a quid pro quo “with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting.\" (Video: The Washington Post, Photo: Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\\nAs he traveled on Air Force One to Texas, Trump called members of the House to argue that the testimony was good for him, according to an aide familiar with the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private talks. Trump also professed to reporters that he had little familiarity with Sondland, a major donor to his inauguration who testified that he had spoken with the president about 20 times.\\n“President Donald J. Trump said, ‘I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I want Zelensky to do the right thing.’ Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified to this in his deposition and repeatedly affirmed it today,” White House press secretary Stephanie \\xadGrisham said after Sondland’s seven-hour testimony concluded. “That should be the only takeaway from today’s sham hearing, and it was stated under oath by the only person in these hearings who has ever spoken directly to President Trump.”\\nLate Wednesday, Republicans faced another round of problematic testimony when Pentagon official Laura Cooper told the House Intelligence Committee that Ukraine asked about the hold on security money on July 25, the day of a pivotal phone call in which Trump asked Zelensky to pursue investigations into his opponents.\\nAdvertisement\\nRepublicans have repeatedly emphasized the idea that Ukrainian officials either never knew the aid was being withheld or knew only for a short time. The White House dismissed Cooper’s revelation as “just an assumption,” arguing that Ukraine asking about the aid “in no way means they knew it was being withheld.”\\nIndeed, Wednesday’s testimony appeared to have little immediate effect on the perspective of Senate Republicans, who will be responsible for deciding Trump’s fate if he is impeached by the House.\\nOn Sondland, key Republican allies sought to undermine the ambassador’s credibility, while insisting that the basic facts had not changed as to whether Trump had committed an impeachable offense by pressuring Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\\n“I say that he’s changed his story several times and one needs to be suspicious of that. But having said that, take what he says, compare it to the facts,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said Wednesday of Sondland. “I just know this: That [Ukraine] got the money, and Hunter Biden and Joe Biden weren’t investigated. That’s what I do know.”\\nAdvertisement\\nSen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) said he heard Sondland’s “interpretation and his presumption, and to me, that kind of makes it a little bit confusing in and of itself.”\\nCentral to the Republicans’ case was testimony from Sondland in which he recounted a Sept. 9 conversation during which Trump, according to the ambassador, said: “I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.” The White House and its allies argued that those remarks were exculpatory, and Trump read them to reporters as he departed from the South Lawn of the White House for Texas.\\nRepublicans also highlighted an exchange from later in the hearing when Rep. Michael R. Turner (R-Ohio), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, pressed Sondland on whether anyone “on this planet” told him that Trump was tying any investigation to the military assistance to Ukraine, which was meant to help the Eastern European nation fend off Russian aggression.\\nAdvertisement\\nSondland responded that no one had, and that his perception of any move to withhold military aid in exchange for a political investigation was based primarily on his “own presumption.”\\n“Mike Turner’s ability to get Ambassador Sondland to say that he had not heard from anyone in the administration that would suggest that aid was tied to any investigations was really powerful and compelling,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), one of Trump’s most ardent defenders in the House. “And certainly if this were a jury trial of peers, there\\'s no way that the president would be convicted.”\\nThat may explain why, despite his characterization of Sondland as “not a man I know well,” Trump has determined that Sondland still offers him a good defense, two advisers said.\\nSome longtime Trump aides said they expected the disclosures to be worse based on Sondland’s opening statement and believed the cross-examination by Republicans in the afternoon was effective. The most effective defense, two White House aides said, was that he could not specify who told him that aid was linked to investigations.\\nAdvertisement\\n“Too many in the media rushed to go make this a great discovery when it is less revealing than Al Capone’s vault,” said Jason Miller, a former campaign aide now leading informal pushback efforts. “The greatest debate going on today was in Gordon Sondland’s head.”\\nThe White House sent 14 different sections of talking points to congressional Republicans, coming in at more than 3,300 words, an official said. Included was a list of 10 times Sondland said he believed or presumed information to be true but could not prove it.\\n“Sondland Could Not Be Clearer, the President Was Not Involved in a Quid Pro Quo,” one segment was headlined, even though Sondland testified in his opening remarks that there was a quid pro quo.\\nOther Trump allies sought to argue that, even if there was a quid pro quo as Sondland had testified, there were other factors to consider.\\nAdvertisement\\n“I don’t think the quid pro quo is the issue. If you’re talking about an illegal quid pro quo, there are legal and illegal quid pro quos,” said Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.). “And an illegal quid pro would be based on a president’s intent.”\\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) also downplayed Sondland’s allegation of conditioning a White House visit for Zelensky on an investigation into the Bidens.\\n“The president can meet with whomever he wants to meet with, and there wasn’t any investigation, was there, of Hunter Biden?” Cornyn said. “It seems to me like they’re stringing together unrelated facts and trying to spin them into a narrative that is a whole lot more sinister than what I think the facts show.”\\nAdded Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), another Trump loyalist in the Senate: “There continue to be this lack of Ukrainians saying they were pressured and lack of evidence that they didn’t get the money, because they did. To me, again, there’s no crime scene.”\\nAdvertisement\\nStill, there was some trepidation inside the White House about Sondland’s testimony, which dramatically undercut previous GOP claims while also implicating Vice President Pence and others as aware of Trump’s pressure campaign.\\nWhite House aides said Sondland was the most damaging witness so far because he actually had interactions with Trump and described key issues in nefarious terms. Sondland is also wealthy, does not need the job and has no particular loyalty to the president, the officials said.\\nBut they believe Sondland’s imprecise answers and sometimes contradictory testimony can be used to undermine him. Some White House aides said they did not understand why Sondland — who appeared under a congressional subpoena — was testifying if he wants to keep his job, though there was no immediate move to shove him out.\\nAdvertisement\\nTrump was so caught up in the hearing that he was 45 minutes late in departing for his trip to tour an Apple factory in Texas, scribbling Sharpie notes about Sondland’s testimony that he carried with him.\\n“I think it was fantastic. They have to end it now,” Trump said of the impeachment inquiry at his appearance in Austin alongside Apple chief executive Tim Cook. “There was no quid pro quo. The president did absolutely nothing wrong.”\\nGiftOutline Gift Article'], 'https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2022/0809/What-the-Mar-a-Lago-search-portends-for-the-US-and-a-president': ['csmonitor.com', 'What the Mar-a-Lago search portends for the US, and a president', 'The Christian Science Monitor, Harry Bruinius Henry Gass Patrik Jonsson Peter Grier, Peter Grier, Henry Gass, Patrik Jonsson, Harry Bruinius', datetime.datetime(2022, 8, 9, 17, 44), \"Today’s situation is more dangerous than Watergate, he says.

But law enforcement experts believe it has heightened Mr. Trump’s legal jeopardy.\\n“The majority of searches of this sort [result] in federal criminal charges,” says Harry Litman, a former U.S. attorney and deputy assistant attorney general.\\nWhat we know at this stage is that the Justice Department is investigating possible illegal retention of official documents by Mr. Trump. Almost all presidential and federal records belong to the U.S. government, not the president or officials themselves, and there are several federal laws outlining what records are illegal for officials to take home with them.\\nTo authorize the search last night, the FBI would have had to convince a federal judge that it was likely the former president had committed a crime, and that evidence of that crime would be found at Mar-a-Lago. And of the possible laws the government may be investigating Mr. Trump of breaking, one stands out: 18 U.S. Code §2071, which prohibits the “concealment, removal, or mutilation” of records belonging to the U.S. government.\\nOfficial charges are likely still some way off, however, if they come at all, according to Chuck Rosenberg, a former U.S. attorney and senior FBI official.\\n“This [search] does not mean that he will ultimately be charged with a crime,” he wrote in an email to the Monitor. “If charges will be brought, it is almost certain that prosecutors and agents have more work to do.”\\nEvelyn Hockstein/Reuters U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, shown at the Department of Justice in Washington, Aug. 2, 2022.\\nBut the timing of the search raises questions. Mr. Trump has said he was cooperating with authorities looking to retrieve government records, raising the possibility that the Justice Department was worried that documents could be destroyed or removed. (The National Archives said in February it was communicating with the DOJ about recovering records from Mr. Trump.)\\nExecuting a search warrant would help prevent such destruction, said Mr. Rosenberg, so that could have been a concern.\\nBut “we do not know that just yet, and we need to be careful about conjecture, here,” he added.\\nThis kind of law enforcement action against a former president is unprecedented, and Justice Department officials would have been aware of that before authorizing the search, according to Mr. Litman, who also teaches constitutional law at the University of California’s San Diego and Los Angeles campuses. They would have been conscious they were serving a warrant on a former president for the first time ever.\\n“It couldn’t have been less than the No. 2” at the DOJ who approved the search, he adds, “and I think it would have been [Attorney General] Garland.”\\nMr. Trump and his allies immediately criticized the search as a politically motivated abuse of power by the Justice Department. But what has happened to Mr. Trump in the past 24 hours is what normally happens to any criminal suspect in such an investigation, experts say.\\n“A ‘neutral and detached’ judge authorized the warrant once prosecutors met the legal threshold required by the Fourth Amendment,” wrote Mr. Rosenberg.\\n“That [criticism] was to be expected ... but this is law enforcement, without fear or favor,” says Mr. Litman.\\nA politicized Justice Department?\\nNews of the FBI raid drew an immediate, fierce response from many Republicans.\\nMr. Trump himself issued a statement that began, “These are dark times for our Nation, as my beautiful home ... is currently under siege, raided and occupied by a large group of FBI agents.”\\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California said the Department of Justice “has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization” and vowed an investigation of Attorney General Garland and the department if the GOP retakes the House in upcoming midterm elections.\\nThe mere fact that such a search occurred, said many Republicans, was meant to influence the November vote while damaging Mr. Biden’s most likely 2024 rival.\\n“What is it, 100 dog days from the congressional election?” says Frank Buckley, a former speechwriter for the Trump campaign and a professor at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University in Arlington, Virginia. “My initial reaction is, we’ve descended from a concrete rule of law to one where justice is influenced by political considerations.”\\nProfessor Buckley volunteered early on to help Mr. Trump win the presidency, and since then he’s been a leading thinker in the transformation of American conservatism, defending the kind of “America First” nationalism that held so much appeal to the movement that swept Mr. Trump into office.\\nHe’s since become a critic of the former president, however, believing Mr. Trump ultimately lacked the character to hold the nation’s highest office – even if his general policy goals overlapped with his own.\\nStill, the search of Mar-a-Lago seems to him to be part of a larger political calculus.\\n“If you’re a Democrat, all you’ve got is Trump, Trump, Trump, and they won’t give it up,” says Professor Buckley, who describes the new brand of conservative ideas in his latest book, “Progressive Conservatism: How Republicans Will Become America’s Natural Governing Party.”\\n“The worst nightmare for Democrats would be [Mr.] Trump saying, I’m not going to run. Well, now he’s much more likely to run, sadly,” he says.\\n“This is serious stuff”\\nThe FBI investigation into Mr. Trump’s retention of presidential records, including classified material, is just one of a number of law enforcement probes the former president is facing.\\nIn New York, Attorney General Letitia James is conducting a civil inquiry into whether The Trump Organization committed fraud by improperly inflating the value of assets.\\nIn Georgia, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is looking at whether to bring criminal charges in conjunction with the efforts of the former president and his allies to overturn the state’s 2020 election results.\\nIn Washington, the Justice Department is conducting a widespread investigation into the larger effort of Trump allies to keep the former president in office despite his election loss.\\nThere is no indication that Monday’s FBI search was linked to questions about Mr. Trump’s effort to pressure state officials or questions dealing with events leading up to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol.\\nSo why did the FBI take the big step of initiating a search of Mr. Trump’s residence? It is possible the FBI believes it was misled about what documents were retained at Mar-a-Lago, and obtained a search warrant on those grounds. It is also possible officials were worried that retained documents were being, or about to be, destroyed.\\nMr. Trump returned 15 boxes of material in January, but only after delaying for many months, and in the face of threatened further action from the National Archives.\\nThe preservation of presidential archives is not a small thing, says Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University historian and editor of “The Presidency of Donald J. Trump: A First Historical Assessment.”\\n“The whole commitment to preservation [of presidential records] really solidifies after Watergate, after the tapes and the battle over the tapes,” says Professor Zelizer. “There’s a realization that this material has consequences, and that sometimes presidents and other politicians don’t want to let people see what happened, because it has a big effect.”\\nDocuments help provide accountability, he says. They provide insight into what presidents did, and what officials in their administration were saying and doing.\\n“This is serious stuff,” says Professor Zelizer.\\nThe larger point is to ensure that no person is above the law, says presidential historian Lindsay Chervinsky, author of “The Cabinet: George Washington and the Creation of an American Institution.”\\nGet stories that\\nempower and uplift daily.

Justice officials may have decided to force the issue.\\nMr. Trump has a solid core of supporters who will back him no matter what, she adds, “so I think that the focus needs to be on doing what is right, even if it is unpopular at the moment – knowing that it would be more damaging to the nation’s future to not do what is right.”\"], 'https://thehill.com/news/house/3516790-what-does-a-jan-6-hearing-victory-look-like-for-democrats/': ['thehill.com', 'What does a Jan. 6 hearing victory look like for Democrats?', 'Mike Lillis, Rebecca Beitsch, Hours Ago, Pm Et, Days Ago, Am Et', datetime.datetime(2022, 6, 9, 9, 22, 10), 'Democrats cheering the congressional investigation into last year’s violent attack on the Capitol face a tricky question as they make their case against former President Trump: What does a victory look like?\\nThe answer seems to be as diverse as the House Democratic Caucus itself.\\nA number of lawmakers said they want the open proceedings, which begin in prime time on Thursday, to provide a high-stakes history lesson of sorts, revealing not only what happened on Jan. 6, 2021, when a pro-Trump mob tried to block the peaceful transfer of power, but why the threat to democracy remains real.\\n“If we reach people with an open mind and inform the public of how close we came to losing our democracy, and provide a sense of urgency about how we’re not out of the woods, I think we’ll have succeeded,” said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who sits on the select committee investigating the attack.\\nAnother group is voicing hopes that the public airing of new revelations about the deadly riot will lead to greater accountability for those who executed it.\\n“Those people who perpetuated this insurrection should be punished, some should go to jail, and we should follow the chain to see where it started — not just from the bottom, but go to the top all the way down,” Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) said.\\nTaking that sentiment a step further, some want the investigators’ findings to amp up the pressure on the Justice Department to prosecute more members of Trump’s inner circle — or even the former president himself — for their role in orchestrating the attack.\\n“I think there will be an increasing demand that something has to happen,” Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) said. “This may be a turning point; the hearings may prompt a kind of response I think many Americans would like to see.”\\nOthers said much of the objective is to highlight the discrepancy between the two parties when it comes to protecting the nation’s institutions from violent insurrection.\\n“This was not some peaceful protest; this was not what the Republican National Committee referred to as ‘legitimate political discourse,’ ” said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.). “This is a way to have the American people make their own judgment.”\\nStill others stressed the importance of preserving America’s role as a global example of how to protect democratic governance, particularly in an age of Russian aggression in Europe and rising autocracies around the world. Victory in this sense, said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), another member of the Jan. 6 committee, hinges on the long-term durability of America’s democratic traditions and institutions.\\n“It’s a long-term test,” Raskin said.\\n“You know that the autocrats and the bullies and the dictators and despots all over Earth have gotten together to try to overthrow democracy, from Moscow to Mar-a-Lago,” he continued. “The truth has a way of getting out there. And we’re determined to say that every American has access to the facts about what took place.”\\nThe debate is happening at a crucial point in the select committee’s yearlong investigation into the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, where hundreds of Trump supporters, animated by the former president’s baseless claims that President Biden’s election victory was fraudulent, stormed into the building in an effort to prevent Congress from certifying the results. Seven people died in connection to the rampage, and roughly 150 police officers were injured while sparring with the rioters.\\nThe initial response from House GOP leaders was to condemn Trump for his role in the unprecedented rampage. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said publicly that Trump “bears responsibility” for the violence, while privately the Republican leader was even more harsh, saying he would urge Trump to resign just days before his presidential term was to end.\\nSince then, however, the tone from Republicans has changed drastically.\\nAlthough banned from Twitter and self-exiled in Florida, Trump remains the most popular Republican figure in the country, raising tens of millions of dollars for campaigns and playing kingmaker in dozens of primary contests from coast to coast. His staying power has forced most GOP leaders to rush to his defense as the select committee has spent months digging into the events surrounding the Capitol riot.\\nOne notable exception, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), was kicked out of her spot in GOP leadership for challenging Trump’s lie about a stolen election. She is now the vice chair of the select committee investigating Jan. 6.\\nMcCarthy, who is actively seeking the Speaker’s gavel if Republicans flip control of the House in November, has led Trump’s defense, opposing an independent commission to investigate the attack and refusing to cooperate in the probe, even under subpoena.\\nAn earlier dispute over the Republican picks for the select committee prompted McCarthy to pull all his selections from the panel. The Republicans have characterized the investigation as a political witch hunt aimed solely at hurting Trump and the GOP politically — a message they’re amplifying this week ahead of Thursday’s prime-time hearing.\\n“They are scrambling to change the headlines, praying that the nation will focus on their partisan witch hunt instead of our pocketbooks. It will not work,” Rep. Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), who replaced Cheney last year as the No. 3 House Republican, said Wednesday.\\nThe members of the bipartisan panel are pressing on, saying the decision by Trump’s GOP allies to downplay the events of Jan. 6 is only more reason to get to the bottom of what happened that day — and air those findings to the country.\\n“They saw on television, and they’ll see again, they’ll be reminded of the fact that this was a violent insurrection; this was not some peaceful protest,” said Hoyer. “Was this legitimate political discourse? Is this the way you think democracy ought to be carried out? Is this the way you think citizens ought to make their point? If it is, we’re in real trouble as a nation.”\\nThe select committee’s decision to stage the hearing at 8 p.m. on Thursday is designed to help the panel disseminate the results of its investigation. But in a sign of the uphill trek the committee is facing, Fox News announced this week that it will not air the event live, as other networks have scheduled.\\n“All we can control is what’s in front of us, and that’s to tell that story,” Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.), a member of the select committee, said. “I hope that people pay attention.”'], 'https://nypost.com/2019/10/28/the-pathetic-push-to-deny-trump-credit-for-getting-baghdadi/': ['nypost.com', 'The pathetic push to deny Trump credit for getting Baghdadi', 'Social Links For Jonathan S. Tobin', datetime.datetime(2019, 10, 28, 23, 54, 9), 'The mockery and the spin from President Trump’s political opponents poured in as soon as he made his announcement on Sunday about US forces killing ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\\nThe president didn’t restrain his urge to take credit for the triumph or hold back on describing the events in pure Trumpspeak. He spoke of Baghdadi “whimpering” and “dying like a dog.” While giving the proper credit to the heroism of the operators who put an end to the career of a murderer and rapist who was one of the planet’s true villains, Trump did the presidential equivalent of an NFL touchdown dance.\\nYet as far as his opponents in the media were concerned, the president’s behavior was not only unseemly but also dishonest, since they think he deserves no credit for a moment that put a bow on the successful war the United States has been waging against ISIS on his watch.\\nThat was the keynote of coverage of the Baghdadi operation in the New York Times, CNN and most other liberal outlets. Instead of allowing Trump to bask in the glory of this victory, reporters and pundits widely bashed the president for supposedly being clueless about the operation and the intelligence establishment, for pursuing policies that made the fight against ISIS harder and for not giving top Democrats a heads up about the impending attack.\\nThey extended Trump none of the adulatory coverage President Barack Obama received in the wake of the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden.\\nWhy is the media more focused on party-pooping on Baghdadi, when they couldn’t stop cheering the bin Laden op?\\nThe killing meant that for at least a day or two, the Democrats’ effort to impeach Trump by any means necessary didn’t dominate the news cycle. \\xadInstead of slanted commentary justifying twisting the president’s unseemly conversation with Ukraine’s leader into an impeachable crime, the country was reminded instead of one of Trump’s inarguable successes: the destruction of the ISIS caliphate that stubbornly resisted Obama’s half-hearted efforts.\\nAs is the case with every other triumph of American arms, the true glory \\xadbelongs to the courageous men and women on the ground who carried out this perilous task — and the intelligence analysts and other US personnel who made it possible.\\nYet as was the case with Obama and bin Laden, Trump gave the final OK for the mission as commander-in-chief. He’s also the one who would have gotten the lion’s share of the blame had it gone wrong, even if failure had been caused by an accident of fate — as President Jimmy Carter learned when the attempt to rescue the US hostages in Iran flopped in April 1980.\\nThat’s why Obama was entitled to boast about bin Laden’s killing even if his own endless touchdown dance was equally unseemly — turning the bravery of Navy SEALs into a partisan talking point throughout the 2012 election.\\nBut however off-putting Trump’s bragging may seem, he actually deserves just as much if not more credit for Baghdadi than Obama did for bin Laden.\\nWhile Trump’s move earlier this month to pull troops out of Syria was misguided, the military defeat of ISIS that sent Baghdadi scurrying to the hole in which he died was the fruit of Trump’s decision-making.\\nObama’s efforts against ISIS were hampered by the White House’s caution and micromanagement. Trump unleashed the US military. He loosened the rules of engagement and took a hands-off approach to the operations planned by the soldiers, Marines and airmen tasked with the job, resulting in the rout of the caliphate.\\nThe test now for Trump is whether he learns from Obama’s mistakes after bin Laden’s death. The rise of ISIS was made possible because Obama acted as if that one operation ended the war on Islamist terror, as he and his surrogates claimed during the 2012 campaign. If Trump treats Baghdadi’s killing as the end of the fight rather than as just one among many battles to be fought and won, his Middle East legacy will be as flawed as that of Obama.\\nBut for now, all those who winked or cheered when Obama used bin Laden as a campaign prop but who now denigrate Trump for treating Baghdadi’s deserved end as a personal triumph need to shut up.\\nJonathan S.

The forest has been hit with a record number of fires this year: More than 74,000 fires have been reported, an 84 percent increase over the number at the same time last year.\\nWell-meaning Americans have eagerly opened their wallets to nonprofit organizations and charities. On Facebook, the top six trending fundraisers are currently related to the Amazon fires and tied to advocacy groups like Amazon Watch, Rainforest Alliance, and Rainforest Foundation Norway.\\n“When people are faced with a tragedy they can’t personally impact, they find ways to feel like they’re doing something,” says associate professor David Karpf, a researcher on digital political advocacy at George Washington University.\\n“There’s not a thing that a person in Ohio can do to directly contribute to the fires in the Amazon”\\nThat’s been the case for decades, he adds. Before the internet, people would mention a disaster to their neighbor, or donate to a local charity and wear its t-shirt to show support for a cause.\\n“There’s not a thing that a person in Ohio can do to directly contribute to the fires in the Amazon,” Karpf says. “But when you see a story like that, you’re moved to action.”\\nDonors generally trust that the organizations they’re giving to will use their money to ethically further the cause, says Stanford University professor Rob Reich, who has written several books on philanthropy and civil society. Still, there’s a broad assumption perpetuated by social media hashtags like #SaveTheAmazon and #ActForTheAmazon that donations will relieve climate change or curb the fires’ impact.\\nAccording to advocacy groups, donated funds are typically used for longer-term projects and support for indigenous communities, like research or government lobbying.\\nFor example, Leonardo DiCaprio’s environmental group, Earth Alliance, said it will distribute funds among a number of local partners that work directly with the indigenous people who live in the Amazon.\\nAmazon Watch, an advocacy nonprofit that has collected money through Facebook Fundraiser, says that most of its funds will be directed toward research and backing indigenous communities’ advocacy efforts in Brazil. While the Amazon fires are an imminent threat, the group is working to change the “destructive environmental policies” put in place by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, according to campaign director Moira Birss. The outpouring of global support during this crisis is much needed, Birss says, but she hopes that concern for the Amazon’s lands doesn’t end after the fires die down.\\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, nearly three-quarters of Americans agree that “social media makes people believe they’re making a difference when they really aren’t.” (Black and Latinx social media users generally thought more positively of social media activism than their white peers.)\\nThe nature of these actions, even in the pre-internet era, has always been performative and self-assuring, Karpf explains. Posting about one’s support for a cause or charity requires almost no commitment and as little effort as a signature for a petition or a few donated dollars. The difference with Instagram and Twitter is that public posts and retweets are now visible for anyone to see.\\nPublic spectacle, for the most part, leads to further discussion and even conflict: The best actionable ways to help “save the Amazon” are currently being disputed online among regular people, activists, and celebrities alike. Celebrities — the likes of DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Madonna, and Kris Jenner — are airing their concerns on social media, some encouraging their fan base to donate as much as they can to verified organizations.\\nFires are raging across the Amazon.

Let\\'s put our power into action and support indigenous efforts to stop the fires and protect the Amazon #Act4Amazonia ➡️ https://t.co/prBhb3McV4 — Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) August 25, 2019\\nIn this era of rampant misinformation, a celebrity endorsement offers an aspect of trust that people rely on when it comes to donating, Reich says.\\nBut as purveyors of information, celebrities aren’t immune to the critics in their comments sections or Twitter replies. Users called them out (and call out each other) for not mentioning the root causes of the fires, such as the Brazilian government’s pro-business agenda, which has spurred large-scale deforestation by loggers and cattle farmers. While donations are helpful, some activists are adamantly encouraging people to eat less meat, which theoretically would slow down Brazil’s major beef-packing industry.\\nOthers argue that the problem is bigger than meat: They say the fires are the cumulative fault of big agribusiness and compliant international governments, whose policies encourage displacement of indigenous people.\\nI\\'m tired of these \"EAT LESS MEAT\" posts in response to the agri-business-linked arsons of the Amazon.\\nThe palm oil in your favorite vegan burger is possible because entire forests in Papua New Guinea were \"cleared\" and burned for the benefit of landowners. — Arrianna M. Planey (@Arrianna_Planey) August 24, 2019\\nThese impassioned arguments reveal how there’s little public consensus on the best collective course of action. Still, some people are moved to donate money — to purchase the peace of mind that their dollars, when pooled together, would be a large enough sum to enact some type of change.\\n“I donated because I hope people running this go fund me [sic] can do what I cannot do alone,” one person commented on their $15 donation to Conservation International.\\n“Let’s do our part to fight the fires!” another wrote with a $25 contribution.\\nViral news allows organizations to rapidly pool together donations, Reich says. But there’s a downside: The news cycle’s hyperactive pace does little to hold them accountable for the money they’ve collected. Months or even years later, people tend to forget or move on from the $10 or $50 they’d contributed.\\nAs Gaby De Valle wrote previously for Vox, crowdfunding is a stopgap solution to systemic issues. It offers a short-term monetary fix to a problem that is typically caused by much bigger forces, from climate change to emergency health care bills.\\n“The first step is retweeting,” says Karpf. “The next is donating to a cause. But then again, we’re a bit too late on the issue of climate change.” (Environmental advocacy efforts compose around 3 percent of Americans’ charitable spending habits, according to Giving USA’s 2018 report on philanthropy in the US.)\\nIn this case, the sweeping Amazon fires were aggravated by record temperatures, drought, and deforestation — risk factors made worse by human activity. No amount of money can literally stop the fires (although Bolsanaro has deployed military aircraft and troops to fight them), but it can help fund advocacy efforts and employ political lobbyists in Brazil and its allying nations.\\n“It’s impossible to ignore politics and think that you can donate money to address climate change or save the Amazon”\\nBrazil had dramatically curbed deforestation in 2014 through conservation measures, international aid, and changes in its soy and beef industry. Bolsonaro’s administration cut back on these environmental efforts, and the Brazilian president is flip-flopping over whether to accept a $22.2 million aid package from the Group of Seven nations.\\n“It’s impossible to ignore politics and think that you can donate money to address climate change or save the Amazon,” Reich says.\\nWith nearly every viral event, there are often opportunistic bad actors who are keen to capitalize on the social media-driven fervor. A number of Instagram accounts in June, for example, falsely claimed that meals would be sent to Sudan for every repost or follow they received, thereby amassing tens of thousands of followers.\\nCrowdfunding sites have cracked down on malicious or false campaigns, but people still fall for them. Donors are generally not inclined to do research on the effectiveness of the charity they’re giving to, says Reich. They’re also more likely to donate if they have a personal connection to a cause or if someone they know asks them to contribute.\\nThe psychology behind personal charity is complicated, Reich adds. Some people see posting about the fires as a virtue — that they’re actively advocating for a cause on their social media. Charity feels meaningful, or at the very least, it holds the promise of an effectively noncommittal solution Americans can partake in from thousands of miles away.\\nSign up for The Goods’ newsletter.

Mike Braun told reporters. \"I think there was some snide remarks like ‘it’s a $2-million book advance’ and all that stuff.”\\nBraun added he thinks it is likely that senators will try to get a copy of the manuscript, but it remains unclear if Republicans will support calling Bolton himself to testify. \"I think Leader McConnell had some good advice: take a deep breath, we’re going to get there anyway, and think about whether you need it,\" he said.\\nOn Monday, a senior Democratic staffer on the impeachment trial dismissed speculation that Bolton had coordinated recently with Democrats on the release of the New York Times story.\\n“We’ve had no communication with Mr. Bolton or Mr. Bolton’s lawyers,” the staffer said.\\nAmid this, Trump’s lawyers are continuing to make their defense. They spoke for nearly 8 hours on Monday and will wrap up their case Tuesday.\\nTrump was charged with the two articles of impeachment in the House for his decision to withhold vital military aid from the country while pressuring it to investigate his political rival, former vice president Joe Biden.\\nTrump’s legal team, led by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and the president’s personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, began their opening arguments Saturday, focusing their attacks on House Democrats and the impeachment process and citing an unfounded conspiracy theory that Ukraine hacked the 2016 election (as the intelligence community has concluded, it was Russia).\\nMonday was the second of three days the president’s team has to make their case. In total, they’ll have 24 hours to argue before the Senate, but they’ve said repeatedly they don’t intend to use their full time to draw contrast with Democrats (who argued for nearly 23 hours over three days) and appease tired senators.\\nTrump’s defense has so far argued that the president did not condition the military aid to Ukraine on his desire for the investigations into the Bidens, though multiple witnesses in the House investigation have said that link was clear.\\nTrump’s defense has also emphasized that the military aid to Ukraine was eventually released, in September, though that was after a whistleblower had filed a complaint about Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky where Trump directly asked for the investigations. After the call, some federal officials had raised questions about the legality of continuing to withhold the aid.\\nTrump’s defense on Saturday focused heavily on an argument that House Democrats had withheld evidence from senators — though the House literally sent carts worth of testimony and other documents to the Senate when it wrapped up its own case. Trump’s lawyers argued that Democrats ignored some testimony that was helpful to the president, while themselves ignoring testimony that was not helpful to Trump.\\nThe president\\'s defense team opened Monday with a broad argument against the legitimacy of impeachment from the most unlikely of sources — Ken Starr, the former special counsel whose investigation led to the impeachment of former president Bill Clinton.\\n“Like war, impeachment is hell,” Starr told the Senate.\\nHe argued that Trump should not be impeached because he was not accused of breaking a specific law. But he also expanded far beyond the current circumstances to make a sweeping argument against impeaching presidents in general. He warned that impeachment “overturns a national election” and causes a “grave disruption of the government.”\\nIt was an abrupt break from Starr’s previous role as a champion of Congress’s impeachment powers. He even cited the Clinton impeachment he once championed as a reason that Congress should avoid this course of action.\\n“The very divisive Clinton impeachment demonstrates that, while highly relevant, the commission of a crime is by no means sufficient to warrant the removal of our duly elected president,” said Starr.\\nOver the course of an hour, Starr highlighted how unusual impeachment has been — Trump’s trial is just the third impeachment trial in American history. He implored the Senate to end the era in American history where Congress regularly wielded its impeachment powers.\\n“I respectfully submit that the Senate should close this chapter, this idiosyncratic chapter, on this increasingly disruptive act, this era, this age of resort to the Constitution’s ultimate democratic weapon for the presidency,” said Starr. “Let the people decide.”\\nLater in the day Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq war combat veteran, criticized Starr\\'s statement. “[Ken Starr] compared his previous impeachment experience to being in war. I\\'ve been in war and sitting in a nice building, getting breaks for lunch and dinner is not like war,\" she said.\\nThe Biden family took center stage in the afternoon portion of the trial Monday as Trump’s legal team turned their focus to the presidential contender and his son, Hunter Biden.\\n“We would prefer not to be talking about this,” said former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, a member of Trump’s defense team — although Trump, his allies, and other Republicans have spent months talking about Hunter Biden. But Bondi said they had no choice but to bring up the Bidens because House impeachment managers first broached the issue in their opening statements.\\nThe White House team heavily implied Biden, when he was vice president, forced Ukraine to fire a prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating a company tied to the Biden family — a discredited conspiracy theory. Trump\\'s defense quoted Shokin claiming that he was fired for investigating Burisma Holdings, a gas company that had Hunter Biden on its board — a theory Shokin only floated long after his removal.\\nShokin was fired under pressure from Democrats and Republicans in the US and allies across the west and Biden bragged publicly about his role in Shokin\\'s ouster. But Shokin was no longer investigating Burisma at the time and was widely seen by Western nations as a corrupt prosecutor who was blocking anti-corruption efforts.\\nBiden\\'s campaign responded in a statement, saying that Trump\\'s team was relying on a \"conspiracy theory\" that has been \"conclusively refuted.\"\\n\"Joe Biden was instrumental to a bipartisan and international anti-corruption victory. It\\'s no surprise that such a thing is anathema to President Trump,\" Biden\\'s rapid response director Andrew Bates wrote.\\nConstitutional lawyer Alan Dershowitz, another member of the White House\\'s defense team, closed Monday\\'s arguments with a lengthy legal argument, suggesting that the Founding Fathers did not intend for any president to be removed from office for abuse of power and that impeachment can only be used for violations of the criminal code. However, Clinton was charged with abuse of power among other articles and Dershowitz argued at the time that the president didn\\'t need to commit a crime to be impeached.\\nDershowitz went on to say Monday that even if Trump did withhold military aid from Ukraine in exchange for dirt on his political opponent, it wouldn\\'t matter, and addressed Bolton\\'s allegations directly.\\n\"Nothing in the Bolton revelations even if true, would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an impeachable offense. That is clear from the history, that is clear from the language of the Constitution,\" he said. \"You cannot turn conduct that is not impeachable into impeachable conduct simply by using words like ‘quid pro quo’ and ‘personal benefit.’ It is inconceivable that the framers would have intended so politically loaded and promiscuously deployed a term as ‘abuse of power’ to be weaponized as a tool of impeachment. It is precisely the kind of vague open-ended and subjective term that the framers feared and rejected.”\\nAfter the Senate wrapped up Monday night, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a former law professor, told reporters that Dershowitz\\' arguments were \"contrary to both law and fact.\"\\n\"His characterization of the law simply is unsupported. He is a criminal law professor who stood in the well of the Senate and talked about how law never inquires into intent and that we should not be using the president\\'s intent as part of understanding impeachment. Criminal law is all about intent. Mens rea is the heart of criminal law. That\\'s the very basis of it. So it makes his whole presentation just nonsensical. I truly could not follow it.\"\\nWhen Trump\\'s defense team finishes their case Tuesday, the Senate will then enter a 16-hour period in which senators can submit handwritten questions to both legal teams. After that, senators will take up an issue that has loomed large over the trial: whether they will call any witnesses to give testimony.\\nDemocrats have pushed hard for witnesses, while the majority of Republicans have argued it is unnecessary. Sens. Susan Collins and Mitt Romney both voted against calling witnesses (along with all Republicans) earlier in the trial but have suggested that they are likely to vote in favor of witnesses later this week.\\n\"I would like to hear from John Bolton,\" Romney told reporters Monday. \"I\\'ve said that for some time, in part because of the fact that he\\'s been one-on-one with the president, and has been pointed out so far by the House managers as well as the defense that there has not been evidence if a direct nature of what the president may have said, or what his motives were, or what he did.\"\\nIn addition to Bolton, Democrats have discussed calling acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to testify. Mulvaney was allegedly deeply involved in the scheme to withhold the Ukraine aid. He acknowledged the link between those actions in a bizarre White House press conference in October, calling it “absolutely appropriate,” but later tried to walk back those comments.\\n\"We\\'ve got both Mick Mulvaney and John Bolton publicly saying that the aid was conditioned upon the investigation,\" Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said Monday, adding he\\'s hopeful Republicans will support calling witnesses.\\n\"I pray that they will because if they don\\'t, they will assign this trial to a standard that\\'s lesser than a trial in the traffic division of the Richmond General District Court,\" Kaine said.\\nSenate Majority Whip John Thune, whose job it is to count Republican votes in the Senate, declined to say Monday if there were enough votes to support bringing witnesses into the trial. \"I think there\\'s been some fluidity in people who have entertained the possibility but also have a lot of questions about what that looks like,\" he said. \"There are a lot of mitigating factors right now and obviously our folks are evaluating it and listening to all the arguments.\"\\nOther new evidence has emerged as the trial has gone on. On Saturday, Lev Parnas — one of two indicted allies of Rudy Giuliani — released a tape, which was obtained by BuzzFeed News, of Trump explicitly telling him and others to “get rid of” the then-US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. Giuliani and Parnas have said that Yovanovitch, who testified in the House’s impeachment inquiry, was an obstacle to their campaign to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and had campaigned to remove her. Additionally, both Ukraine and the US are now investigating whether Yovanovitch was under surveillance by Giuliani associates at the time. She was ultimately recalled from her post in Kyiv and told that the president had wanted her out.'], 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-historic-vote-trump-acquitted-of-impeachment-charges/2020/02/05/8b7ea90e-4832-11ea-ab15-b5df3261b710_story.html': ['washingtonpost.com', 'In historic vote, Trump acquitted of impeachment charges', 'Seung Min Kim', datetime.datetime(2020, 2, 6, 1, 33, 5), 'The Senate on Feb. 5 voted to acquit President Trump on both articles of impeachment. (Video: U.S. Senate)\\nComment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\\nPresident Trump was acquitted Wednesday by the Republican-controlled Senate of charges that he abused the powers of his office and obstructed Congress as it probed his attempts to pressure Ukraine into political investigations — capping a tumultuous, three-week impeachment trial that leaves his fate in the hands of voters in November.\\nDemocrats fell far short of the two-thirds majority required to remove Trump from office, as senators voted 52 to 48 to acquit him on the abuse-of-power allegation and 53 to 47 to clear him of obstruction.\\nThe outcome represented a political triumph for the White House and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who successfully held together nearly the entire GOP caucus in blocking witnesses or additional evidence from the proceedings. Just one Republican, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, voted to convict the president of abuse of power.\\nAdvertisement\\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said he will vote to convict President Trump in a speech on Feb. 5 in the Senate. (Video: The Washington Post)\\nShortly after the twin acquittal votes, Trump tweeted that he will deliver a statement Thursday on “our Country’s VICTORY on the Impeachment Hoax!” He also tweeted a clip featuring a mock magazine cover with signs showing him staying in office far beyond the two terms permitted under the Constitution. And Brad Parscale, Trump’s 2020 campaign manager, proclaimed that he had been “totally vindicated.”\\n“Throughout this wholly corrupt process, President Trump successfully advanced the interests of the United States and remained focused on the issues that matter to Americans,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said. “He spent his time achieving real victories for the people of this country, and the Democrats — once again — have nothing to show for their fraudulent schemes.”\\nThe third impeachment trial of a president in U.S. history concluded one of the most bitter episodes in recent memory in Washington — marked by partisan fighting over what constitutes a fair trial, furious debates over the propriety of Trump’s dealings with Ukraine and outsized pressure on a small core of Republican senators who held considerable sway in whether the trial would subpoena key witnesses from the Trump administration who had defied calls to appear before the House during its investigation.\\nAdvertisement\\nBut the vote by Romney, the party’s 2012 presidential nominee, robbed the president of the unified GOP opposition against impeachment that he had enjoyed and repeatedly boasted of since the inquiry began in September. Romney is the first senator in history to vote to remove a president of his or her own party.\\nRomney called Trump’s demand to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter a “flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security and our fundamental values.” In a July 25 phone call with Zelensky that he has repeatedly described as “perfect,” Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate not only the Bidens but a discredited theory that it was Ukraine rather than Russia that attempted to interfere in the 2016 election.\\n“There’s no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the president would never have done what he did,” Romney said in an eight-minute speech delivered in a Senate chamber that was nearly void of his colleagues. Later, he added: “Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one’s oath of office that I can imagine.”\\nAdvertisement\\nRomney was the sole senator who not only defected from his own party but split his vote, choosing to acquit Trump of obstructing Congress.\\nDemocrats accused Republicans of emboldening an unchecked president who sought foreign influence in U.S. campaigns for his personal benefit. Republicans portrayed Democrats as a party still embittered by its loss in the 2016 presidential elections that has now decided to weaponize the constitutional impeachment process.\\n“This sham process is the low point in the Senate for me,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), once a Trump foe who has transformed into one of the president’s closest allies. “If you think you’ve done the country a good service by legitimizing this impeachment process, what you have done is unleashed the partisan forces of hell.”\\nThe question of whether Trump should stay in office now moves from the Senate chamber to the campaign trail. Just one day prior, Trump stayed away from any mention of impeachment in Tuesday’s State of the Union address, although he is almost certain to tout his acquittal at rallies and in other venues, such as Thursday’s planned statement, as he campaigns for a second term.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe issue is also likely to surface in competitive Senate races, mostly as Democrats target GOP senators for aligning themselves with Trump and his conduct. But in a victory lap news conference after the votes, McConnell said the Democrats’ decision to proceed with impeachment was a “colossal political mistake.”\\nThe majority leader noted that Trump is enjoying some of his strongest approval ratings now and added that “as a poll watcher who’s looking at polls in certain Senate races, every one of our people in tough races . . . is in better shape today than they were before the impeachment trial started.”\\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) insisted that Democrats were not motivated by politics and said “Democrats walked out of the Senate chamber with their heads held high.”\\nRipples from impeachment also may continue in the House, with Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and one of the impeachment managers, saying Wednesday that Democrats will probably subpoena former national security adviser John Bolton in the near future.\\nAdvertisement\\n“When you have a lawless president, you have to bring that to the fore, you have to spotlight that,” Nadler told reporters. Bolton has said he would appear before the Senate if subpoenaed but has been silent on whether he would appear before the House.\\nDespite weeks of protests from Democrats, the Senate last week voted not to hear from additional witnesses, including Bolton, during the trial. An unpublished manuscript from the ex-White House official’s forthcoming book has alleged that Trump directly tied the withholding of nearly $400 million in military assistance to Ukraine to the political investigations the president had demanded.\\nThe tone inside the chamber during the historic vote was solemn, as each senator took turns standing up at his or her desk and proclaiming “guilty” or “not guilty” to each article of impeachment. The public galleries were the most crowded they have been throughout the trial, as the backbenches on the chamber floor, reserved for members of the House who wanted to attend the trial, filled in with congressmen from both parties.\\nAdvertisement\\nRep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the lead prosecutor for House managers, sat in the first chair of their table, turned at a three-quarters position so he could swivel his head around the chamber with every senator’s name called out, glancing around the room. When each of the two roll calls ended, he pivoted around to stare at the clerks and parliamentarians as they double checked the votes.\\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. read the results after each vote, proclaiming Trump not guilty of both charges. Shortly after, McConnell thanked Roberts for presiding over the proceedings with a “clear head, steady hand and the forbearance that this rare occasion demands.”\\nTrump was impeached by the House on Dec. 18, as nearly all Democrats there proclaimed that he had abused his powers and then obstructed Congress’s attempts to investigate him. At the heart the case against Trump presented by the impeachment managers was the allegation that he withheld military aid and a coveted White House meeting to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. The younger Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, while his father was vice president.\\nAdvertisement\\nThroughout the acrimonious Senate trial, the only real point of suspense — aside from where a handful of senators would land on the conviction vote — was whether a majority of senators in the narrowly divided chamber would decide to call more witnesses, particularly after the Bolton revelations.\\nDemocrats cited polling that showed the public broadly favored summoning witnesses to Trump’s impeachment trial, and argued it was only fair to hear from Trump administration officials whom the White House had summarily blocked from testifying before the House, some even under a subpoena. But most Senate Republicans, many of whom took no public issue with the president’s conduct, said it was not their responsibility to secure witnesses and documents, particularly when House Democrats didn’t exhaust their options to obtain them, such as going to court.\\nUnlike in the House, in which a handful of Democratic lawmakers split from their party to oppose either article of impeachment, Senate Democrats stayed united in their stance that Trump deserved to be removed from office for his conduct.\\nAdvertisement\\nSen. Doug Jones (Ala.), who faces the toughest reelection bid for an incumbent Democrat this fall, chose to convict on both impeachment articles, saying he was “deeply troubled” by the White House legal team’s case arguing for “virtually unchecked presidential power.” Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.), a freshman senator who has bucked her party on occasion, also voted guilty on both.\\nSo did Sen. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.), one of the few Democratic lawmakers who has a relationship with Trump and was seen as perhaps the White House’s best chance at a bipartisan acquittal. Manchin, who in recent days began floating a censure resolution that gained little traction in either party, announced his decision shortly before senators gathered to vote at 4 p.m., and inside the chamber, Sinema approached him and the two whispered to one another and hugged.\\n“Despite the false claim that a president can do no wrong, the president is not entitled to act with blatant disregard for an equal branch of government or use the superpower status of the United States to condition our support of democracy and our allies on any political favor,” Manchin said.\\nAs for the lone party defector, the GOP backlash against Romney began to mount immediately, with the president’s son, Donald Trump, Jr., calling on Senate Republicans to expel him from the conference. Romney’s own colleagues were gentler in their disagreement, with Republican leaders saying they did not try to persuade him one way or another on the conviction vote.\\n“He’s made it very clear from the beginning, even on the witness vote, that he was going to go his own way,” said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.). “This is one of those historical votes where everybody has to do what they think is the right thing.”\\nThe impeachment trial also became entwined with the 2020 Democratic presidential campaign, forcing the four senators still in the race — Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Michael F. Bennet (Colo.) — off the trail just weeks before the first nominating contests began Monday in Iowa.\\nAt a campaign stop Wednesday morning in Derry, N.H., before he zipped back down to Washington, Sanders called Trump a “pathological liar” who “probably doesn’t know the difference between truth and lies.”\\nPaul Kane, Mike DeBonis, Felicia Sonmez, Colby Itkowitz and John Wagner in Washington and Sean Sullivan in Derry, N.H., contributed to this report.\\nGiftOutline Gift Article'], 'https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/08/3-crucial-breakdowns-in-journalistic-standards-that-explain-the-atlantics-trump-political-hit-piece/': ['thefederalist.com', \"3 Breakdowns In Standards That Explain The Atlantic's Trump Hit Piece\", 'Christopher Bedford, Christopher Bedford Is The Executive Editor Of The Upcoming Common Sense Magazine, The Common Sense Society.

Among this sizable set of folks stretching from the Hill to its consultants to their non-profits, Labor Day is half-sacred. The lazy, end-of-summer weekend away took a broadside Thursday night, however, when The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg published a badly sourced, difficult-to-confirm, belief-stretching story about President Donald Trump denigrating America’s honored dead at Belleau Woods, France.\\nThe political motivation of the accusations was laid bare by early Friday morning when MSNBC debuted a political attack ad based on the piece that was prepared in a deeply suspicious record time. The trap was set — and poor adherence to journalistic practices made it all possible.\\nThroughout the long weekend, skeptical journalists cast serious doubts on the Goldberg’s standards and methods, and on what passes today as “confirmation,” but for those outside the media industry it’s a he-said-she-said with potentially serious political consequences for the president. So what exactly did The Atlantic and its legions of friends do wrong here and why can’t we believe this reporting on its face? The answer could fill a semester of basic journalism school, but boiled down: poor sourcing practices, confirmation bias, and an echo chamber’s misleading “confirmations” dominated the cycle.\\nSourcing\\nAnonymity is like crack in politics, and especially since President Trump has been elected, everyone is addicted. Anonymity was once a rare thing, given only when convincing evidence of serious risk to the source was presented alongside a story important enough to make the trade worthwhile. Even then, reporters (or at least their editors) felt rightly compelled to justify why they made the call to demand suspicious readers trust their by-nature secret vetting process.\\nOver the past few years, reporters and editors have increasingly abandoned these rules in a greedy rush to capitalize on the sieve-like culture of Trump’s early White House and Democrats’ investigatory committees, scoring points against their new nemesis and getting clicks along the way. More and more often, no reason is even given for the anonymity, and sources treat newspapers as dumping grounds for cowardly and ungrounded political hits they’re not held accountable for. The reporters and editors, equally addicted to the attention that breaking news brings, allow it.\\nToday, senior staffers demand anonymity for comments as benign and boring as complimenting their boss, and reporters who say “no” or even just publicly detail their reason for concealing a source’s name can often expect an angry phone call. In one I recall, an exasperated communications staffer who is normally soft-spoken heatedly demanded a reason for my refusal to cite an anonymous administration official without an explanation when “CNN and Newsweek had no issue with it.”\\nAnonymity is not simply used by sources, but unscrupulous reporters who blend who is who to cover for the rumors, gossip, and innuendo they pass as journalism these days. Phrases like “according to former and current officials,” for example, sound important but the reality of many of the actually important jobs in government is former employees don’t know what is happening one week after they’ve left the building. For some reporters, using phrasing to blend a host of “formers” in with maybe one current employee creates the illusion of exhaustive reporting and trustworthy sourcing.\\nAnonymity is most dangerous when it’s used to make attacks. Washington is filled with “senior officials,” and the White House alone has dozens. If those sources are not in the room, did not see or hear the thing said, or can’t provide documents, emails, or other evidence to back their claims, good reporters can’t report them.\\nFeeling so close to something you cannot nail down is deeply frustrating, but the good reporters and editors should be satisfied knowing they at least have a lead to pursue until it can be proven or disproven. It’s as simple as that. In the case of Goldberg’s Atlantic story, notice none of those cited are primary sources. Most college professors wouldn’t accept secondary sourcing for a term paper, but somehow the editor in chief of The Atlantic held himself to this standard.\\nEven more egregiously in the case of Goldberg’s story is that substantial primary sources existed, including both people and documents. They are contradicting the secondary-source rumor-mongering that was the entire lead of the piece. That should have earned a swift no-publish call, but instead their qualms went completely unmentioned.\\nI would be much more inclined to believe Goldberg’s piece if he’d included the FOIA docs or the Bolton account of the trip in his lede or bridge. He didn’t. He’s the EIC of the Atlantic. Excluding that info was probably not a mistake. — Geoffrey Ingersoll (@GPIngersoll) September 7, 2020\\nIt shows he was probably only concerned w telling what he thought was a truth, versus the whole truth. — Geoffrey Ingersoll (@GPIngersoll) September 7, 2020\\nI just watched Goldberg's interview on CNN and was struck by his response to evidence that the flight to the cemetery was canceled for weather. Both Bolton and Pentagon sources have confirmed that reason, and Goldberg says that that all may be true… https://t.co/CaKg1rVyTJ — Jonathan Turley (@JonathanTurley) September 6, 2020\\nTo be aware of this massive hole, as Goldberg clearly is, but run the story anyways points to a host of other problems that stretch across the industry, among them confirmation bias, or the inclination to believe things that fit into and confirm your worldview.\\nConfirmation Bias\\nConfirmation bias is true across most human interactions, but in journalism, it has reached comedic levels. At The Atlantic just a month ago, The Federalist exposed and outed a story that begins with a police officer going unpunished for shooting a black child for skipping a basketball sign-in sheet at a community rec center.\\nIt was the kind of story you might not wonder deeply about if you feel that police officers are actively hunting black children and going unpunished for it, but for those who don’t believe that is the case, the story was suspicious. As it turned out, the story was suspicious because it was false. The Atlantic would have saved itself embarrassment had its editors, who are more inclined to believe things like this, so much as asked for a newspaper clip to confirm the story.\\nThe age of Donald Trump has put this on steroids, leaving once-careful publications eager to believe, print, and reprint stories about the Ku Klux Klan depressing the black vote by distributing joints at polling centers, or the gross idea that there’s a Russian “pee-tape” of the famously germaphobic president. Or that President Trump, who while in France stood in the rain to honor American war dead, would cancel a day to honor American war dead because they are “losers” and the rain would hurt his hair.\\nReporters have to be very careful of stereotypes. While all people use them in some capacity to understand the world, they intrinsically lead to a dumb caricature of reality when pushed toward their limits. Trump insults the service of Sen. John McCain and attacks the father of a dead American soldier, both of whom he had public, living, back-and-forth feuds with, so why would he not attack men who died long before he was born, and whom he had traveled to France in part to honor?\\nOr, “Trump denigrated McCain’s service, therefore he will denigrate the service of those who died in World War I.” If you wholeheartedly believe the caricature of a belligerent, hateful, anti-military man it makes sense, but if you study the person it doesn’t compute.\\n“Trump’s understanding of concepts such as patriotism, service, and sacrifice,” Goldberg writes, “has interested me since he expressed contempt for the war record of the late Senator John McCain, who spent more than five years as a prisoner of the North Vietnamese.”\\nThis kind of confirmation bias leads to a quickness to believe, which can lead to not asking the right questions — a fatal mistake for good reporting. “Are there people in the room who could verify this? Have they already gone on the record on this situation?”\\nWithin hours of the story’s evening release, a campaign ad was apparently produced, filmed, and pitched. By mid-day Friday, multiple news outlets had managed to “find” the multiple anonymous sources Goldberg used and “confirm” the story. This strongly, strongly suggests a coordinated political hit, and makes other important questions that were skipped even more salient.\\nQuestions like “Why in September 2020, two years after this allegedly happened, are we first hearing it?” Or, “Why, when Gen. John Kelly and John Bolton are on-the-record critics of the president, did they not share this? The latter wrote a book on hating the president.” Kelly is a much more private man, but was publicity hound Bolton even asked? It would have helped Goldberg to check, since Bolton, like others actually there, quickly denied the accusations.\\nBoth sources and bias-confirmation come together into the echo chamber, where more and more, corporate reporters act as protective amplifiers instead of skeptical peer-reviewers.\\nThe Echo Chamber\\nOften when a conservative-leaning source breaks a story — even one supported by primary sourcing — the report is met with corporate silence. Stories with a leftward bent, on the other end, are met with resounding applause and repetition, as when the Politico story on a Ku Klux marijuana plot was repeated unquestioningly by outlets like Vanity Fair, US News And World Report, The Root, and Philly Voice.\\nNeither Neil Patel nor I would have let this run, that’s for sure. But there’s also an element of self preservation there. The Caller’d have gotten eaten alive for this, whereas Goldberg can assume wide deference and protection among fellow media types. — Geoffrey Ingersoll (@GPIngersoll) September 7, 2020\\nMore dangerous to public trust than simple repetition, however, is “confirmation” masquerading as such. In the wake of Goldberg’s story, a suspiciously large number of outlets “confirmed” his reporting, which noticeably had neither documents nor primary sourcing to “confirm” — only gossip “according to four [unnamed] people with firsthand knowledge of the discussion that day.”\\nLet me be clear: If the source is telling you what he thinks someone said because he was told as much by someone else, it is gossip, and you cannot confirm gossip simply using the last person on the chain. You must go to the primary sources, and if you can’t confirm the gossip there then you cannot report the story is confirmed.\\nAll outlets can do by speaking with the same sources as Goldberg did is confirm he spoke to them, that they repeated their claim, and hopefully notice a thread that went unpulled and try to get to the end of it. To say “XYZ outlet has confirmed The Atlantic’s story” when they simply spoke with the same sources is false — repetition is not confirmation.\\nThat doesn’t mean there aren’t ways to forward the story. Other outlets can absolutely confirm that the source is not make-believe, although no one serious wondered if Goldberg had invented a source (it’s not like he’s MSNBC’s Mike Barnicle, who’s managed to cling onto media acclaim despite doing just that).\\nAll of these, however, lead to a major problem in corporate media: An unskeptical belief the president is a bad man who must be defeated has led to discarding an ever-growing number of essential journalistic practices. It’s the reason more and more Americans don’t trust their media — and it’s a good one.\"], 'https://www.axios.com/jan-6-poll-axios-momentive-26ba0f30-e2b1-4530-803c-860e6302c5a9.html': ['axios.com', 'Exclusive poll: Americans fear a Jan. 6 repeat', 'Margaret Talev David Nather, Https, Www.Axios.Com Authors Mtalev Https, Www.Axios.Com Authors Dnather', datetime.datetime(2022, 1, 5, 10, 0, 21), 'Data: Axios/Momentive polls; Chart: Will Chase/Axios\\nA majority of Americans expect a repeat in the next few years of something like the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol — and just half say they now have faith in American democracy, according to a new Axios-Momentive poll.\\nThe big picture: The survey shows that fewer than six in 10 Americans say President Biden legitimately won the 2020 election — a share that hasn\\'t changed since our poll last year, published hours before the Jan. 6 insurrection.\\nThe doubts have survived Biden\\'s inauguration and months of governance, as well as the lack of evidence of any substantial election fraud — and multiple investigations and audits that debunked former President Donald Trump\\'s lie that the election was stolen.\\nWhat they\\'re saying: \"It\\'s dispiriting to see that this shocking thing we all witnessed last year hasn\\'t changed people\\'s perceptions,\" said Laura Wronski, senior manager for research science at Momentive.\\nEither Biden \"hasn\\'t done enough\" or \"it shows that he never had a chance,\" she said. \"The partisan division is still the story.\"\\nBy the numbers: In a Momentive poll conducted Jan. 4-5, 2021 just ahead of Biden\\'s certification, 58% of Americans said they accepted that Biden had legitimately won the election. That number is now at 55%, essentially a wash from a year ago.\\nAbout 57% of Americans — about half of Republicans and seven in 10 Democrats — say more events similar to Jan. 6 are likely to happen in the next few years.\\nAccording to the poll, 63% say the attack changed the way Americans think about the democratic government, with about half of those saying the change is permanent and others saying it\\'s temporary.\\nAnd 58% said they support the work of the House select committee on Jan. 6. There\\'s a huge partisan gap — 88% among Democrats, 58% among independents and 32% among Republicans.\\nIn addition, 56% of Americans support the committee\\'s ability to subpoena documents and testimony — and 51% support criminal penalties including prison time if witnesses refuse to comply. But again, those numbers are driven largely by the strong support among Democrats.\\nBetween the lines: About 37% of those surveyed say they\\'ve lost faith in American democracy, while 10% said they never had any faith. Another 49% said they do have faith.\\nBut it\\'s actually Republicans (47%) more than Democrats (28%) saying they\\'ve lost faith, suggested their response has more to do with who\\'s in the Oval Office now than the defiance of the former president and some of his supporters.\\nRepublicans are three or four times as likely as Democrats to say voter fraud is a problem in their state.\\nThe intrigue: While partisanship was a huge divide in the survey, age was another. Older Americans were far more concerned about the fate of democracy than younger respondents, and also more likely to support the work of the Jan. 6 commission.\\nAbout 19% of respondents said democracy is the issue that matters most to them right now, even above the economy or health care.\\nThat was true for 31% of Democrats and 14% of Republicans.\\nIt was true for just 8% of respondents younger than 35, but 41% of those 65 and older.\\nWhat we\\'re watching: Democrats were far more likely to say government functions better when more people vote (79%) than Republicans (46%), while Republicans were two to three times as likely to say what\\'s more important is that the \"right people\" vote.\\nMethodology: This Momentive online poll was conducted January 1-3, 2022, among a national sample of 2,649 adults.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Horowitz discussed a litany of embarrassing slip-ups by the FBI, including the actions of a lawyer who the inspector general said \"doctored\" an email to make it seem like Page was not a CIA source, when in fact he was. That potentially exculpatory information was never shared with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which approved the surveillance warrant.\\nHorowitz also said he could not rule out political bias as a possible motivation for the 17 errors the FBI made in applications for the Page surveillance.\\n\"Can you say it wasn’t because of political bias?\" Graham asked.\\n\"I do not know,\" Horowitz replied.\\nGraham asked Horowitz about an op-ed by former FBI James Comey, who proclaimed that the IG report vindicated him.\\n\"You know, I think the activities we found here don\\'t vindicate anybody who touched this,\" Horowitz replied.\\nThe ranking Democrat on the committee, Sen. Pat Leahy of Vermont, asked Horowitz about a statement after the release of the IG report by John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut who has been tasked by Attorney General William Barr with conducting a broader investigation into the origins of the Russia probe.\\n\"Based on the evidence collected to date, and while our investigation is ongoing, last month we advised the inspector general that we do not agree with some of the report’s conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened,\" Durham said on Monday.\\nHorowitz told Leahy he was surprised by Durham\\'s statement, and he painted the disagreement as a narrow one. Horowitz said Durham agreed that opening a preliminary investigation was justified, but not a full field investigation, as the FBI opened. That is a narrow and technical difference. A Justice Department spokeswomen was not immediately available for comment.\\nThrough a spokesperson, Durham declined to comment.\\nHorowitz also said that he found no evidence the FBI sought to insert informants into the Trump campaign.

People at the highest level of our government took the law into their own hands.\"\\nHe painted a picture of a group of anti-Trumpers within the FBI who cooked up a bogus investigation.\\nIn fact, the IG found no evidence that political bias tainted the FBI\\'s Russia probe, which was run mostly by career civil servants. Two FBI officials whose texts displayed bias against Trump played a minimal role, the IG report says.\\nHorowitz did find a series of errors in how the bureau got approval for conducting electronic surveillance of Page, who ultimately was never charged with a crime. And he found some concerns with how the FBI approached its investigation into a presidential campaign.\\nHorowitz also confirmed that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the FBI conducted a counterintelligence briefing for Trump on Aug. 17, 2016, to warn him about foreign threats, including from Russia.\\nNBC News first reported on this meeting in December 2017.\\nTrump and his top aides never alerted the FBI to the many approaches by Russians to their campaign, according to former special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s report.\\nThe inspector general report says that the FBI used the August 2016 meeting to test the reaction of Trump adviser Michael Flynn, who by then was under investigation as a suspected foreign agent.\\nAn FBI agent who helped with the briefing also wrote a report, known as an FBI 302.\\nSen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said this was an abuse of the briefing process by the FBI. Horowitz did not disagree.\\nThe FBI never conducted a full \"defensive briefing\" in which it would have warned Trump that members of his campaign were under a counterintelligence investigation.

Trump paid $750 in federal income taxes the year he won the presidency. In his first year in the White House, he paid another $750.\\nHe had paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years — largely because he reported losing much more money than he made.\\nAs the president wages a re-election campaign that polls say he is in danger of losing, his finances are under stress, beset by losses and hundreds of millions of dollars in debt coming due that he has personally guaranteed. Also hanging over him is a decade-long audit battle with the Internal Revenue Service over the legitimacy of a $72.9 million tax refund that he claimed, and received, after declaring huge losses. An adverse ruling could cost him more than $100 million.\\nThe tax returns that Mr. Trump has long fought to keep private tell a story fundamentally different from the one he has sold to the American public. His reports to the I.R.S. portray a businessman who takes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year yet racks up chronic losses that he aggressively employs to avoid paying taxes. Now, with his financial challenges mounting, the records show that he depends more and more on making money from businesses that put him in potential and often direct conflict of interest with his job as president.\\nThe New York Times has obtained tax-return data extending over more than two decades for Mr. Trump and the hundreds of companies that make up his business organization, including detailed information from his first two years in office. It does not include his personal returns for 2018 or 2019. This article offers an overview of The Times’s findings; additional articles will be published in the coming weeks.\\nThe returns are some of the most sought-after, and speculated-about, records in recent memory. In Mr. Trump’s nearly four years in office — and across his endlessly hyped decades in the public eye — journalists, prosecutors, opposition politicians and conspiracists have, with limited success, sought to excavate the enigmas of his finances. By their very nature, the filings will leave many questions unanswered, many questioners unfulfilled. They comprise information that Mr. Trump has disclosed to the I.R.S., not the findings of an independent financial examination. They report that Mr. Trump owns hundreds of millions of dollars in valuable assets, but they do not reveal his true wealth. Nor do they reveal any previously unreported connections to Russia.\\nIn response to a letter summarizing The Times’s findings, Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said that “most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate” and requested the documents on which they were based. After The Times declined to provide the records, in order to protect its sources, Mr. Garten took direct issue only with the amount of taxes Mr. Trump had paid.\\n“Over the past decade, President Trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government, including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015,” Mr. Garten said in a statement.\\nWith the term “personal taxes,” however, Mr. Garten appears to be conflating income taxes with other federal taxes Mr. Trump has paid — Social Security, Medicare and taxes for his household employees. Mr. Garten also asserted that some of what the president owed was “paid with tax credits,” a misleading characterization of credits, which reduce a business owner’s income-tax bill as a reward for various activities, like historic preservation.\\nThe tax data examined by The Times provides a road map of revelations, from write-offs for the cost of a criminal defense lawyer and a mansion used as a family retreat to a full accounting of the millions of dollars the president received from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.\\nTogether with related financial documents and legal filings, the records offer the most detailed look yet inside the president’s business empire. They reveal the hollowness, but also the wizardry, behind the self-made-billionaire image — honed through his star turn on “The Apprentice” — that helped propel him to the White House and that still undergirds the loyalty of many in his base.\\nUltimately, Mr. Trump has been more successful playing a business mogul than being one in real life.\\n“The Apprentice,” along with the licensing and endorsement deals that flowed from his expanding celebrity, brought Mr. Trump a total of $427.4 million, The Times’s analysis of the records found. He invested much of that in a collection of businesses, mostly golf courses, that in the years since have steadily devoured cash — much as the money he secretly received from his father financed a spree of quixotic overspending that led to his collapse in the early 1990s.\\n“The Apprentice,” along with endorsements and other income that sprang from his growing fame, brought Donald Trump $427.4 million. Rob DeLorenzo/Zuma Press\\nIndeed, his financial condition when he announced his run for president in 2015 lends some credence to the notion that his long-shot campaign was at least in part a gambit to reanimate the marketability of his name.\\nAs the legal and political battles over access to his tax returns have intensified, Mr. Trump has often wondered aloud why anyone would even want to see them. “There’s nothing to learn from them,” he told The Associated Press in 2016. There is far more useful information, he has said, in the annual financial disclosures required of him as president — which he has pointed to as evidence of his mastery of a flourishing, and immensely profitable, business universe.\\nIn fact, those public filings offer a distorted picture of his financial state, since they simply report revenue, not profit. In 2018, for example, Mr. Trump announced in his disclosure that he had made at least $434.9 million. The tax records deliver a very different portrait of his bottom line: $47.4 million in losses.\\nTax records do not have the specificity to evaluate the legitimacy of every business expense Mr. Trump claims to reduce his taxable income — for instance, without any explanation in his returns, the general and administrative expenses at his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey increased fivefold from 2016 to 2017. And he has previously bragged that his ability to get by without paying taxes “makes me smart,” as he said in 2016. But the returns, by his own account, undercut his claims of financial acumen, showing that he is simply pouring more money into many businesses than he is taking out.\\nThe picture that perhaps emerges most starkly from the mountain of figures and tax schedules prepared by Mr. Trump’s accountants is of a businessman-president in a tightening financial vise.\\nMost of Mr. Trump’s core enterprises — from his constellation of golf courses to his conservative-magnet hotel in Washington — report losing millions, if not tens of millions, of dollars year after year.\\nListen to This Article\\nHis revenue from “The Apprentice” and from licensing deals is drying up, and several years ago he sold nearly all the stocks that now might have helped him plug holes in his struggling properties.\\nThe tax audit looms.\\nAnd within the next four years, more than $300 million in loans — obligations for which he is personally responsible — will come due.\\nAgainst that backdrop, the records go much further toward revealing the actual and potential conflicts of interest created by Mr. Trump’s refusal to divest himself of his business interests while in the White House. His properties have become bazaars for collecting money directly from lobbyists, foreign officials and others seeking face time, access or favor; the records for the first time put precise dollar figures on those transactions.\\nAt the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., a flood of new members starting in 2015 allowed him to pocket an additional $5 million a year from the business. In 2017, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association paid at least $397,602 to the Washington hotel, where the group held at least one event during its four-day World Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians.\\nThe Times was also able to take the fullest measure to date of the president’s income from overseas, where he holds ultimate sway over American diplomacy. When he took office, Mr. Trump said he would pursue no new foreign deals as president. Even so, in his first two years in the White House, his revenue from abroad totaled $73 million. And while much of that money was from his golf properties in Scotland and Ireland, some came from licensing deals in countries with authoritarian-leaning leaders or thorny geopolitics — for example, $3 million from the Philippines, $2.3 million from India and $1 million from Turkey.\\nIn the Philippines, where Mr. Trump licensed his name to a Manila tower, he or his companies paid $156,824 in taxes in 2017. Hannah Reyes Morales for The New York Times\\nHe reported paying taxes, in turn, on a number of his overseas ventures. In 2017, the president’s $750 contribution to the operations of the U.S. government was dwarfed by the $15,598 he or his companies paid in Panama, the $145,400 in India and the $156,824 in the Philippines.\\nThe $750 Tax Bill Here’s how his accountants arrived at that figure in 2017.\\nMr. Trump’s U.S. payment, after factoring in his losses, was roughly equivalent, in dollars not adjusted for inflation, to another presidential tax bill revealed nearly a half-century before. In 1973, The Providence Journal reported that, after a charitable deduction for donating his presidential papers, Richard M. Nixon had paid $792.81 in 1970 on income of about $200,000.\\nThe leak of Mr. Nixon’s small tax payment caused a precedent-setting uproar: Henceforth, presidents, and presidential candidates, would make their tax returns available for the American people to see.\\nA Map of the Empire\\nThe contents of thousands of personal and business tax records fill in financial details that have been withheld for years.\\n“I would love to do that,” Mr. Trump said in 2014 when asked whether he would release his taxes if he ran for president. He’s been backpedaling ever since.\\nWhen he ran, he said he might make his taxes public if Hillary Clinton did the same with the deleted emails from her private server — an echo of his taunt, while stoking the birther fiction, that he might release the returns if President Barack Obama released his birth certificate. He once boasted that his tax returns were “very big” and “beautiful.” But making them public? “It’s very complicated.” He often claims that he cannot do so while under audit — an argument refuted by his own I.R.S. commissioner. When prosecutors and congressional investigators issued subpoenas for his returns, he wielded not just his private lawyers but also the power of his Justice Department to stalemate them all the way to the Supreme Court.\\nMr. Trump’s elaborate dance and defiance have only stoked suspicion about what secrets might lie hidden in his taxes. Is there a financial clue to his deference to Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin? Did he write off as a business expense the hush-money payment to the pornographic film star Stormy Daniels in the days before the 2016 election? Did a covert source of money feed his frenzy of acquisition that began in the mid-2000s?\\nThe Times examined and analyzed the data from thousands of individual and business tax returns for 2000 through 2017, along with additional tax information from other years. The trove included years of employee compensation information and records of cash payments between the president and his businesses, as well as information about ongoing federal audits of his taxes. This article also draws upon dozens of interviews and previously unreported material from other sources, both public and confidential.\\nAll of the information The Times obtained was provided by sources with legal access to it. While most of the tax data has not previously been made public, The Times was able to verify portions of it by comparing it with publicly available information and confidential records previously obtained by The Times.\\nTo delve into the records is to see up close the complex structure of the president’s business interests — and the depth of his entanglements. What is popularly known as the Trump Organization is in fact a collection of more than 500 entities, virtually all of them wholly owned by Mr. Trump, many carrying his name. For example, 105 of them are a variation of the name Trump Marks, which he uses for licensing deals.\\nFragments of Mr. Trump’s tax returns have leaked out before.\\nTranscripts of his main federal tax form, the 1040, from 1985 to 1994, were obtained by The Times in 2019. They showed that, in many years, Mr. Trump lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer. Three pages of his 1995 returns, mailed anonymously to The Times during the 2016 campaign, showed that Mr. Trump had declared losses of $915.7 million, giving him a tax deduction that could have allowed him to avoid federal income taxes for almost two decades. Five months later, the journalist David Cay Johnston obtained two pages of Mr. Trump’s returns from 2005; that year, his fortunes had rebounded to the point that he was paying taxes.\\nIn 1995, the year Mr. Trump broke ground on the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York, he would declare losses of $915.7 million — a sum so large, it could be carried forward to cancel out taxable income for years. Francis Specker/New York Post Archives, via NYP Holdings, Inc., via Getty Images By 2005, his fortunes had turned and he was paying income taxes: He had exhausted the tax-reducing power of that nearly $1 billion loss just as he began to see a surge of celebrity income after “The Apprentice” debuted. Michael Nagle/Getty Images\\nThe vast new trove of information analyzed by The Times completes the recurring pattern of ascent and decline that has defined the president’s career. Even so, it has its limits.\\nTax returns do not, for example, record net worth — in Mr. Trump’s case, a topic of much posturing and almost as much debate. The documents chart a great churn of money, but while returns report debts, they often do not identify lenders.\\nThe data contains no new revelations about the $130,000 payment to Stephanie Clifford, the actress who performs as Stormy Daniels — a focus of the Manhattan district attorney’s subpoena for Mr. Trump’s tax returns and other financial information. Mr. Trump has acknowledged reimbursing his former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, who made the payoff, but the materials obtained by The Times did not include any itemized payments to Mr. Cohen. The amount, however, could have been improperly included in legal fees written off as a business expense, which are not required to be itemized on tax returns.\\nNo subject has provoked more intense speculation about Mr. Trump’s finances than his connection to Russia. While the tax records revealed no previously unknown financial connection — and, for the most part, lack the specificity required to do so — they did shed new light on the money behind the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, a subject of enduring intrigue because of subsequent investigations into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.\\nThe records show that the pageant was the most profitable Miss Universe during Mr. Trump’s time as co-owner, and that it generated a personal payday of $2.3 million — made possible, at least in part, by the Agalarov family, who would later help set up the infamous 2016 meeting between Trump campaign officials seeking “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton and a Russian lawyer connected to the Kremlin.\\nIn August, the Senate Intelligence Committee released a report that looked extensively into the circumstances of the Moscow pageant, and revealed that as recently as February, investigators subpoenaed the Russian singer Emin Agalarov, who was involved in planning it. Mr. Agalarov’s father, Aras, a billionaire who boasts of close ties to Mr. Putin, was Mr. Trump’s partner in the event.\\nEmin Agalarov, left, a Russian singer whose family was involved in planning the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. Mr. Trump made $2.3 million from that year’s pageant, the records show. Irina Bujor/Kommersant.ru, via Associated Press\\nThe committee interviewed a top Miss Universe executive, Paula Shugart, who said the Agalarovs offered to underwrite the event; their family business, Crocus Group, paid a $6 million licensing fee and another $6 million in expenses. But while the pageant proved to be a financial loss for the Agalarovs — they recouped only $2 million — Ms. Shugart told investigators that it was “one of the most lucrative deals” the Miss Universe organization ever made, according to the report.\\nThat is borne out by the tax records. They show that in 2013, the pageant reported $31.6 million in gross receipts — the highest since at least the 1990s — allowing Mr. Trump and his co-owner, NBC, to split profits of $4.7 million. By comparison, Mr. Trump and NBC shared losses of $2 million from the pageant the year before the Moscow event, and $3.8 million from the one the year after.\\nLoser, Winner\\nLosses reported by businesses Mr. Trump owns and runs helped wipe out tax bills on hundreds of millions of dollars in celebrity income.\\nWhile Mr. Trump crisscrossed the country in 2015 describing himself as uniquely qualified to be president because he was “really rich” and had “built a great company,” his accountants back in New York were busy putting the finishing touches on his 2014 tax return.\\nAfter tabulating all the profits and losses from Mr. Trump’s various endeavors on Form 1040, the accountants came to Line 56, where they had to enter the total income tax the candidate was required to pay. They needed space for only a single figure.\\nZero.\\nFor Mr. Trump, that bottom line must have looked familiar. It was the fourth year in a row that he had not paid a penny of federal income taxes.\\nMr. Trump’s avoidance of income taxes is one of the most striking discoveries in his tax returns, especially given the vast wash of income itemized elsewhere in those filings.\\nMr. Trump’s net income from his fame — his 50 percent share of “The Apprentice,” together with the riches showered upon him by the scores of suitors paying to use his name — totaled $427.4 million through 2018. A further $176.5 million in profit came to him through his investment in two highly successful office buildings.\\nSo how did he escape nearly all taxes on that fortune? Even the effective tax rate paid by the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans could have caused him to pay more than $100 million.\\nThe answer rests in a third category of Mr. Trump’s endeavors: businesses that he owns and runs himself. The collective and persistent losses he reported from them largely absolved him from paying federal income taxes on the $600 million from “The Apprentice,” branding deals and investments.\\nThat equation is a key element of the alchemy of Mr. Trump’s finances: using the proceeds of his celebrity to purchase and prop up risky businesses, then wielding their losses to avoid taxes.\\nThroughout his career, Mr. Trump’s business losses have often accumulated in sums larger than could be used to reduce taxes on other income in a single year. But the tax code offers a workaround: With some restrictions, business owners can carry forward leftover losses to reduce taxes in future years.\\nThat provision has been the background music to Mr. Trump’s life. As The Times’s previous reporting on his 1995 return showed, the nearly $1 billion in losses from his early-1990s collapse generated a tax deduction that he could use for up to 18 years going forward.\\nThe newer tax returns show that Mr. Trump burned through the last of the tax-reducing power of that $1 billion in 2005, just as a torrent of entertainment riches began coming his way following the debut of “The Apprentice” the year before.\\nFor 2005 through 2007, cash from licensing deals and endorsements filled Mr. Trump’s bank accounts with $120 million in pure profit. With no prior-year losses left to reduce his taxable income, he paid substantial federal income taxes for the first time in his life: a total of $70.1 million.\\nAs his celebrity income swelled, Mr. Trump went on a buying spree unlike any he had had since the 1980s, when eager banks and his father’s wealth allowed him to buy or build the casinos, airplanes, yacht and old hotel that would soon lay him low.\\nWhen “The Apprentice” premiered, Mr. Trump had opened only two golf courses and was renovating two more. By the end of 2015, he had 15 courses and was transforming the Old Post Office building in Washington into a Trump International Hotel. But rather than making him wealthier, the tax records reveal as never before, each new acquisition only fed the downward draft on his bottom line.\\nConsider the results at his largest golf resort, Trump National Doral, near Miami. Mr. Trump bought the resort for $150 million in 2012; through 2018, his losses have totaled $162.3 million. He has pumped $213 million of fresh cash into Doral, tax records show, and has a $125 million mortgage balance coming due in three years.\\nTrump National Doral near Miami, Mr. Trump’s largest golf resort. Since 2000, he has reported losing $315.6 million at his golf courses. Scott McIntyre for The New York Times\\nHis three courses in Europe — two in Scotland and one in Ireland — have reported a combined $63.6 million in losses.\\nOver all, since 2000, Mr. Trump has reported losses of $315.6 million at the golf courses that are his prized possessions.\\nFor all of its Trumpworld allure, his Washington hotel, opened in 2016, has not fared much better. Its tax records show losses through 2018 of $55.5 million.\\nAnd Trump Corporation, a real estate services company, has reported losing $134 million since 2000. Mr. Trump personally bankrolled the losses year after year, marking his cash infusions as a loan with an ever-increasing balance, his tax records show. In 2016, he gave up on getting paid back and turned the loan into a cash contribution.\\nMr. Trump has often posited that his losses are more accounting magic than actual money out the door.\\nLast year, after The Times published details of his tax returns from the 1980s and 1990s, he attributed the red ink to depreciation, which he said in a tweet would show “losses in almost all cases” and that “much was non monetary.”\\n“I love depreciation,” Mr. Trump said during a presidential debate in 2016.\\nDepreciation, though, is not a magic wand — it involves real money spent or borrowed to buy buildings or other assets that are expected to last years. Those costs must be spread out as expenses and deducted over the useful life of the asset. Even so, the rules do hold particular advantages for real estate developers like Mr. Trump, who are allowed to use their real estate losses to reduce their taxable income from other activities.\\nWhat the tax records for Mr. Trump’s businesses show, however, is that he has lost chunks of his fortune even before depreciation is figured in. The three European golf courses, the Washington hotel, Doral and Trump Corporation reported losing a total of $150.3 million from 2010 through 2018, without including depreciation as an expense.\\nTo see what a successful business looks like, depreciation or not, look no further than one in Mr. Trump’s portfolio that he does not manage.\\nAfter plans for a Trump-branded mini-city on the Far West Side of Manhattan stalled in the 1990s, Mr. Trump’s stake was sold by his partner to Vornado Realty Trust. Mr. Trump objected to the sale in court, saying he had not been consulted, but he ended up with a 30 percent share of two valuable office buildings owned and operated by Vornado.\\nHis share of the profits through the end of 2018 totaled $176.5 million, with depreciation factored in. He has never had to invest more money in the partnership, tax records show.\\nAmong businesses he runs, Mr. Trump’s first success remains his best. The retail and commercial spaces at Trump Tower, completed in 1983, have reliably delivered more than $20 million a year in profits, a total of $336.3 million since 2000 that has done much to help keep him afloat.\\nMr. Trump has an established track record of stiffing his lenders. But the tax returns reveal that he has failed to pay back far more money than previously known: a total of $287 million since 2010.\\nThe I.R.S. considers forgiven debt to be income, but Mr. Trump was able to avoid taxes on much of that money by reducing his ability to declare future business losses. For the rest, he took advantage of a provision of the Great Recession bailout that allowed income from canceled debt to be completely deferred for five years, then spread out evenly over the next five. He declared the first $28.2 million in 2014.\\nOnce again, his business losses mostly absolved his tax responsibilities. He paid no federal income taxes for 2014.\\nMr. Trump was periodically required to pay a parallel income tax called the alternative minimum tax, created as a tripwire to prevent wealthy people from using huge deductions, including business losses, to entirely wipe out their tax liabilities.\\nMr. Trump paid alternative minimum tax in seven years between 2000 and 2017 — a total of $24.3 million, excluding refunds he received after filing. For 2015, he paid $641,931, his first payment of any federal income tax since 2010.\\nAs he settled into the Oval Office, his tax bills soon returned to form. His potential taxable income in 2016 and 2017 included $24.8 million in profits from sources related to his celebrity status and $56.4 million for the loans he did not repay. The dreaded alternative minimum tax would let his business losses erase only some of his liability.\\nEach time, he requested an extension to file his 1040; and each time, he made the required payment to the I.R.S. for income taxes he might owe — $1 million for 2016 and $4.2 million for 2017. But virtually all of that liability was washed away when he eventually filed, and most of the payments were rolled forward to cover potential taxes in future years.\\nTo cancel out the tax bills, Mr. Trump made use of $9.7 million in business investment credits, at least some of which related to his renovation of the Old Post Office hotel, which qualified for a historic-preservation tax break. Although he had more than enough credits to owe no taxes at all, his accountants appear to have carved out an allowance for a small tax liability for both 2016 and 2017.\\nWhen they got to line 56, the one for income taxes due, the amount was the same each year: $750.\\nThe $72.9 Million Maneuver\\n“The Apprentice” created what was probably the biggest income tax bite of Mr. Trump’s life. During the Great Recession bailout, he asked for the money back.\\nTestifying before Congress in February 2019, the president’s estranged personal lawyer, Mr. Cohen, recalled Mr. Trump’s showing him a huge check from the U.S. Treasury some years earlier and musing “that he could not believe how stupid the government was for giving someone like him that much money back.”\\nIn fact, confidential records show that starting in 2010 he claimed, and received, an income tax refund totaling $72.9 million — all the federal income tax he had paid for 2005 through 2008, plus interest.\\nThe legitimacy of that refund is at the center of the audit battle that he has long been waging, out of public view, with the I.R.S.\\nThe records that The Times reviewed square with the way Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited, without explanation, an ongoing audit as grounds for refusing to release his tax returns. He alluded to it as recently as July on Fox News, when he told Sean Hannity, “They treat me horribly, the I.R.S., horribly.”\\nAnd while the records do not lay out all the details of the audit, they match his lawyers’ statement during the 2016 campaign that audits of his returns for 2009 and subsequent years remained open, and involved “transactions or activities that were also reported on returns for 2008 and earlier.”\\nMr. Trump harvested that refund bonanza by declaring huge business losses — a total of $1.4 billion from his core businesses for 2008 and 2009 — that tax laws had prevented him from using in prior years.\\nBut to turn that long arc of failure into a giant refund check, he relied on some deft accounting footwork and an unwitting gift from an unlikely source — Mr. Obama.\\nBusiness losses can work like a tax-avoidance coupon: A dollar lost on one business reduces a dollar of taxable income from elsewhere. The types and amounts of income that can be used in a given year vary, depending on an owner’s tax status. But some losses can be saved for later use, or even used to request a refund on taxes paid in a prior year.\\nUntil 2009, those coupons could be used to wipe away taxes going back only two years. But that November, the window was more than doubled by a little-noticed provision in a bill Mr. Obama signed as part of the Great Recession recovery effort. Now business owners could request full refunds of taxes paid in the prior four years, and 50 percent of those from the year before that.\\nMr. Trump had paid no income taxes in 2008. But the change meant that when he filed his taxes for 2009, he could seek a refund of not just the $13.3 million he had paid in 2007, but also the combined $56.9 million paid in 2005 and 2006, when “The Apprentice” created what was likely the biggest income tax bite of his life.\\nThe records reviewed by The Times indicate that Mr. Trump filed for the first of several tranches of his refund several weeks later, in January 2010. That set off what tax professionals refer to as a “quickie refund,” a check processed in 90 days on a tentative basis, pending an audit by the I.R.S.\\nHis total federal income tax refund would eventually grow to $70.1 million, plus $2,733,184 in interest. He also received $21.2 million in state and local refunds, which often piggyback on federal filings.\\nWhether Mr. Trump gets to keep the cash, though, remains far from a sure thing.\\nRefunds require the approval of I.R.S. auditors and an opinion of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, a bipartisan panel better known for reviewing the impact of tax legislation. Tax law requires the committee to weigh in on all refunds larger than $2 million to individuals.\\nRecords show that the results of an audit of Mr. Trump’s refund were sent to the joint committee in the spring of 2011. An agreement was reached in late 2014, the documents indicate, but the audit resumed and grew to include Mr. Trump’s returns for 2010 through 2013. In the spring of 2016, with Mr. Trump closing in on the Republican nomination, the case was sent back to the committee. It has remained there, unresolved, with the statute of limitations repeatedly pushed forward.\\nPrecisely why the case has stalled is not clear. But experts say it suggests that the gap between the sides remains wide. If negotiations were to deadlock, the case would move to federal court, where it could become a matter of public record.\\nThe dispute may center on a single claim that jumps off the page of Mr. Trump’s 2009 tax return: a declaration of more than $700 million in business losses that he had not been allowed to use in prior years. Unleashing that giant tax-avoidance coupon enabled him to receive some or all of his refund.\\nThe material obtained by The Times does not identify the business or businesses that generated those losses. But the losses were a kind that can be claimed only when partners give up their interest in a business. And in 2009, Mr. Trump parted ways with a giant money loser: his long-failing Atlantic City casinos.\\nMr. Trump announced in 2009 that he was abandoning his stake in his Atlantic City casino business. Mark Makela for The New York Times\\nAfter Mr. Trump’s bondholders rebuffed his offer to buy them out, and with a third round of bankruptcy only a week away, Mr. Trump announced in February 2009 that he was quitting the board of directors.\\n“If I’m not going to run it, I don’t want to be involved in it,” he told The Associated Press. “I’m one of the largest developers in the world. I have a lot of cash and plenty of places I can go.”\\nThe same day, he notified the Securities and Exchange Commission that he had “determined that his partnership interests are worthless and lack potential to regain value” and was “hereby abandoning” his stake.\\nThe language was crucial. Mr. Trump was using the precise wording of I.R.S. rules governing the most beneficial, and perhaps aggressive, method for business owners to avoid taxes when separating from a business.\\nA partner who walks away from a business with nothing — what tax laws refer to as abandonment — can suddenly declare all the losses on the business that could not be used in prior years. But there are a few catches, including this: Abandonment is essentially an all-or-nothing proposition. If the I.R.S. learns that the owner received anything of value, the allowable losses are reduced to just $3,000 a year.\\nAnd Mr. Trump does appear to have received something. When the casino bankruptcy concluded, he got 5 percent of the stock in the new company. The materials reviewed by The Times do not make clear whether Mr. Trump’s refund application reflected his public declaration of abandonment. If it did, that 5 percent could place his entire refund in question.\\nIf the auditors ultimately disallow Mr. Trump’s $72.9 million federal refund, he will be forced to return that money with interest, and possibly penalties, a total that could exceed $100 million. He could also be ordered to return the state and local refunds based on the same claims.\\nIn response to a question about the audit, Mr. Garten, the Trump Organization lawyer, said facts cited by The Times were incorrect, without citing specifics. He did, however, write that it was “illogical” to say Mr. Trump had not paid taxes for those three years just because the money was later refunded.\\n“While you claim that President Trump paid no taxes in 10 of the 15 previous years,” Mr. Garten said, “you also assert that President Trump claimed a massive refund for tens of millions for taxes he did pay. These two claims are entirely inconsistent and, in any event, not supported by the facts.”\\nHouse Democrats who have been in hot pursuit of Mr. Trump’s tax returns most likely have no idea that at least some of the records are sitting in a congressional office building. George Yin, a former chief of staff for the joint committee, said that any identifying information about taxpayers under review was tightly held among a handful of staff lawyers and was rarely shared with politicians assigned to the committee.\\nIt is possible that the case has been paused because Mr. Trump is president, which would raise the personal stakes of re-election. If the recent Fox interview is any indication, Mr. Trump seems increasingly agitated about the matter.\\n“It’s a disgrace what’s happened,” he told Mr. Hannity. “We had a deal done. In fact, it was — I guess it was signed even. And once I ran, or once I won, or somewhere back a long time ago, everything was like, ‘Well, let’s start all over again.’ It’s a disgrace.”\\nThe 20 Percent Solution\\nHelping to reduce Mr. Trump’s tax bills are unidentified consultants’ fees, some of which can be matched to payments received by Ivanka Trump.\\nExamining the Trump Organization’s tax records, a curious pattern emerges: Between 2010 and 2018, Mr. Trump wrote off some $26 million in unexplained “consulting fees” as a business expense across nearly all of his projects.\\nIn most cases the fees were roughly one-fifth of his income: In Azerbaijan, Mr. Trump collected $5 million on a hotel deal and reported $1.1 million in consulting fees, while in Dubai it was $3 million with a $630,000 fee, and so on.\\nMysterious big payments in business deals can raise red flags, particularly in places where bribes or kickbacks to middlemen are routine. But there is no evidence that Mr. Trump, who mostly licenses his name to other people’s projects and is not involved in securing government approvals, has engaged in such practices.\\nRather, there appears to be a closer-to-home explanation for at least some of the fees: Mr. Trump reduced his taxable income by treating a family member as a consultant, and then deducting the fee as a cost of doing business.\\nThe “consultants” are not identified in the tax records. But evidence of this arrangement was gleaned by comparing the confidential tax records to the financial disclosures Ivanka Trump filed when she joined the White House staff in 2017. Ms. Trump reported receiving payments from a consulting company she co-owned, totaling $747,622, that exactly matched consulting fees claimed as tax deductions by the Trump Organization for hotel projects in Vancouver and Hawaii.\\nEric, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. with their father at an announcement of the Vancouver hotel project in 2013. Ms. Trump appears to have both managed that deal, and another in Hawaii, as a salaried Trump Organization executive, and also been paid as a “consultant” on them. Jonathan Hayward/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press\\nMs. Trump had been an executive officer of the Trump companies that received profits from and paid the consulting fees for both projects — meaning she appears to have been treated as a consultant on the same hotel deals that she helped manage as part of her job at her father’s business.\\nWhen asked about the arrangement, the Trump Organization lawyer, Mr. Garten, did not comment.\\nEmployers can deduct consulting fees as a business expense and also avoid the withholding taxes that apply to wages. To claim the deduction, the consulting arrangement must be an “ordinary and necessary” part of running the business, with fees that are reasonable and market-based, according to the I.R.S. The recipient of the fees is still required to pay income tax.\\nThe I.R.S. has pursued civil penalties against some business owners who devised schemes to avoid taxes by paying exorbitant fees to related parties who were not in fact independent contractors. A 2011 tax court case centered on the I.R.S.’s denial of almost $3 million in deductions for consulting fees the partners in an Illinois accounting firm paid themselves via corporations they created. The court concluded that the partners had structured the fees to “distribute profits, not to compensate for services.”\\nThere is no indication that the I.R.S. has questioned Mr. Trump’s practice of deducting millions of dollars in consulting fees. If the payments to his daughter were compensation for work, it is not clear why Mr. Trump would do it in this form, other than to reduce his own tax liability. Another, more legally perilous possibility is that the fees were a way to transfer assets to his children without incurring a gift tax.\\nA Times investigation in 2018 found that Mr. Trump’s late father, Fred Trump, employed a number of legally dubious schemes decades ago to evade gift taxes on millions of dollars he transferred to his children. It is not possible to discern from this newer collection of tax records whether intra-family financial maneuverings were a motivating factor.\\nHowever, the fact that some of the consulting fees are identical to those reported by Mr. Trump’s daughter raises the question of whether this was a mechanism the president used to compensate his adult children involved with his business. Indeed, in some instances where large fees were claimed, people with direct knowledge of the projects were not aware of any outside consultants who would have been paid.\\nOn the failed hotel deal in Azerbaijan, which was plagued by suspicions of corruption, a Trump Organization lawyer told The New Yorker the company was blameless because it was merely a licenser and had no substantive role, adding, “We did not pay any money to anyone.” Yet, the tax records for three Trump L.L.C.s involved in that project show deductions for consulting fees totaling $1.1 million that were paid to someone.\\nIn Turkey, a person directly involved in developing two Trump towers in Istanbul expressed bafflement when asked about consultants on the project, telling The Times there was never any consultant or other third party in Turkey paid by the Trump Organization. But tax records show regular deductions for consulting fees over seven years totaling $2 million.\\nMs. Trump disclosed in her public filing that the fees she received were paid through TTT Consulting L.L.C., which she said provided “consulting, licensing and management services for real estate projects.” Incorporated in Delaware in December 2005, the firm is one of several Trump-related entities with some variation of TTT or TTTT in the name that appear to refer to members of the Trump family.\\nLike her brothers Donald Jr. and Eric, Ms. Trump was a longtime employee of the Trump Organization and an executive officer for more than 200 Trump companies that licensed or managed hotel and resort properties. The tax records show that the three siblings had each drawn a salary from their father’s company — roughly $480,000 a year, jumping to about $2 million after Mr. Trump became president — though Ms. Trump no longer receives a salary. What’s more, Mr. Trump has said the children were intimately involved in negotiating and managing his projects. When asked in a 2011 lawsuit deposition whom he relied on to handle important details of his licensing deals, he named only Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric.\\nOn Ms. Trump’s now-defunct website, which explains her role at the Trump Organization, she was not identified as a consultant. Rather, she has been described as a senior executive who “actively participates in all aspects of both Trump and Trump branded projects, including deal evaluation, predevelopment planning, financing, design, construction, sales and marketing, and ensuring that Trump’s world-renowned physical and operational standards are met.\\n“She is involved in all decisions — large and small.”\\nThe Art of the Write-Off\\nHair stylists, table linens, property taxes on a family estate — all have been deducted as business expenses.\\nPrivate jets, country clubs and mansions have all had a role in the selling of Donald Trump.\\n“I play to people’s fantasies,” he wrote in “Trump: The Art of the Deal.” “People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole. It’s an innocent form of exaggeration — and a very effective form of promotion.”\\nIf the singular Trump product is Trump in an exaggerated form — the man, the lifestyle, the acquisitiveness — then everything that feeds the image, including the cost of his businesses, can be written off on his taxes. Mr. Trump may be reporting business losses to the government, but he can still live a life of wealth and write it off.\\nTake, for example, Mar-a-Lago, now the president’s permanent residence as well as a private club and stage set on which Trump luxury plays out. As a business, it is also the source of millions of dollars in expenses deducted from taxable income, among them $109,433 for linens and silver and $197,829 for landscaping in 2017. Also deducted as a business expense was the $210,000 paid to a Florida photographer over the years for shooting numerous events at the club, including a 2016 New Year’s Eve party hosted by Mr. Trump.\\nMar-a-Lago, where a flood of new members starting in 2015 allowed Mr. Trump to pocket an additional $5 million a year from the business, is also a source of millions in tax deductions. Saul Martinez for The New York Times\\nMr. Trump has written off as business expenses costs — including fuel and meals — associated with his aircraft, used to shuttle him among his various homes and properties. Likewise the cost of haircuts, including the more than $70,000 paid to style his hair during “The Apprentice.” Together, nine Trump entities have written off at least $95,464 paid to a favorite hair and makeup artist of Ivanka Trump.\\nIn allowing business expenses to be deducted, the I.R.S. requires that they be “ordinary and necessary,” a loosely defined standard often interpreted generously by business owners.\\nPerhaps Mr. Trump’s most generous interpretation of the business expense write-off is his treatment of the Seven Springs estate in Westchester County, N.Y.\\nSeven Springs is a throwback to another era. The main house, built in 1919 by Eugene I. Meyer Jr., the onetime head of the Federal Reserve who bought The Washington Post in 1933, sits on more than 200 acres of lush, almost untouched land just an hour’s drive north of New York City.\\n“The mansion is 50,000 square feet, has three pools, carriage houses, and is surrounded by nature preserves,” according to The Trump Organization website.\\nMr. Trump had big plans when he bought the property in 1996 — a golf course, a clubhouse and 15 private homes. But residents of surrounding towns thwarted his ambitions, arguing that development would draw too much traffic and risk polluting the drinking water.\\nMr. Trump instead found a way to reap tax benefits from the estate. He took advantage of what is known as a conservation easement. In 2015, he signed a deal with a land conservancy, agreeing not to develop most of the property. In exchange, he claimed a $21.1 million charitable tax deduction.\\nMr. Trump classified the Seven Springs estate as an investment property, not a personal residence, allowing for certain tax savings. Meanwhile, Eric Trump has called it a “home base,” and the Trump Organization website describes it as a “retreat for the Trump family.” Tony Cenicola/The New York Times\\nThe tax records reveal another way Seven Springs has generated substantial tax savings. In 2014, Mr. Trump classified the estate as an investment property, as distinct from a personal residence. Since then, he has written off $2.2 million in property taxes as a business expense — even as his 2017 tax law allowed individuals to write off only $10,000 in property taxes a year.\\nCourts have held that to treat residences as businesses for tax purposes, owners must show that they have “an actual and honest objective of making a profit,” typically by making substantial efforts to rent the property and eventually generating income.\\nWhether or not Seven Springs fits those criteria, the Trumps have described the property somewhat differently.\\nIn 2014, Eric Trump told Forbes that “this is really our compound.” Growing up, he and his brother Donald Jr. spent many summers there, riding all-terrain vehicles and fishing on a nearby lake. At one point, the brothers took up residence in a carriage house on the property. “It was home base for us for a long, long time,” Eric told Forbes.\\nAnd the Trump Organization website still describes Seven Springs as a “retreat for the Trump family.”\\nMr. Garten, the Trump Organization lawyer, did not respond to a question about the Seven Springs write-off.\\nThe Seven Springs conservation-easement deduction is one of four that Mr. Trump has claimed over the years. While his use of these deductions is widely known, his tax records show that they represent the lion’s share of his charitable giving — about $119.3 million of roughly $130 million in personal and corporate charitable contributions reported to the I.R.S.\\nThe Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles, another site where Mr. Trump has claimed a conservation-easement deduction. Bryan Denton for The New York Times\\nTwo of those deductions — at Seven Springs and at the Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles — are the focus of an investigation by the New York attorney general, who is examining whether the appraisals on the land, and therefore the tax deductions, were inflated.\\nAnother common deductible expense for all businesses is legal fees. The I.R.S. requires that these fees be “directly related to operating your business,” and businesses cannot deduct “legal fees paid to defend charges that arise from participation in a political campaign.”\\nYet the tax records show that the Trump Corporation wrote off as business expenses fees paid to a criminal defense lawyer, Alan S. Futerfas, who was hired to represent Donald Trump Jr. during the Russia inquiry. Investigators were examining Donald Jr.’s role in the 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians who had promised damaging information on Mrs. Clinton. When he testified before Congress in 2017, Mr. Futerfas was by his side.\\nMr. Futerfas was also hired to defend the president’s embattled charitable foundation, which would be shut down in 2018 after New York regulators said it had engaged in “a shocking pattern of illegality.”\\nThe Trump Corporation paid Mr. Futerfas at least $1.9 million in 2017 and 2018, tax records show. Also written off was at least $259,684 paid to Williams & Jensen, another law firm brought in during the same period to represent Donald Trump Jr.\\nA President and a Businessman\\nDeals in countries led by strongmen, tenants who have business before the federal government, and hotels and clubs that draw those seeking access or favor.\\nIn May, the chairman of a trade group representing Turkish business interests wrote to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross urging support for increased trade between the United States and Turkey. The ultimate goal was nothing less than “reorienting the U.S. supply chain away from China.”\\nThe letter was among three sent to cabinet secretaries by Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, chairman of the Turkey-U.S. Business Council, who noted that he had copied each one to Mr. Trump.\\nThe president needed no introduction to Mr. Yalcindag: The Turkish businessman helped negotiate a licensing deal in 2008 for his family’s company to develop two Trump towers in Istanbul. The tax records show the deal has earned Mr. Trump at least $13 million — far more than previously known — including more than $1 million since he entered the White House, even as his onetime associate now lobbies on behalf of Turkish interests.\\nMr. Yalcindag said he had “remained friendly” with Mr. Trump since their work together years ago, but that all communications between his trade group and the administration “go through formal channels and are properly disclosed.”\\nMehmet Ali Yalcindag, pictured with the Trumps in 2012, helped negotiate a licensing deal in Istanbul that brought Mr. Trump at least $13 million. He now lobbies on behalf of Turkish business interests. Trump Organization, via PR Newswire\\nThe ethical quandaries created by Mr. Trump’s decision to keep his business while in the White House have been documented. But the full financial measure of his extraordinary confluence of interests — a president with a wealth of business entanglements at home and in myriad geopolitical hot spots — has remained elusive.\\nThe tax records for Mr. Trump and his hundreds of companies show precisely how much money he has received over the years, and how heavily he has come to rely on leveraging his brand in ways that pose potential or direct conflicts of interest while he is president. The records also provide the first reliable window onto his finances before 2014, the earliest year covered by his required annual disclosures, showing that his total profits from some projects outside the United States were larger than indicated by those limited public filings.\\nBased on the financial disclosures, which report much of his income in broad ranges, Mr. Trump’s earnings from the Istanbul towers could have been as low as $3.2 million. In the Philippines, where he licensed his name to a Manila tower nearly a decade ago, the low end of the range was $4.1 million — less than half of the $9.3 million he actually made. In Azerbaijan, he collected more than $5 million for the failed hotel project, about twice what appeared on his public filings.\\nIt did not take long for conflicts to emerge when Mr. Trump ran for president and won. The Philippines’ strongman leader, Rodrigo Duterte, chose as a special trade envoy to Washington the businessman behind the Trump tower in Manila. In Argentina, a key person who had been involved in a Uruguayan licensing deal that earned Mr. Trump $2.3 million was appointed to a cabinet post.\\nThe president’s conflicts have been most evident with Turkey, where the business community and the authoritarian government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have not hesitated to leverage various Trump enterprises to their advantage. When Turkish-American relations were at a low point, a Turkish business group canceled a conference at Mr. Trump’s Washington hotel; six months later, when the two countries were on better terms, the rescheduled event was attended by Turkish government officials. Turkish Airlines also chose the Trump National Golf Club in suburban Virginia to host an event.\\nMore broadly, the tax records suggest other ways in which Mr. Trump’s presidency has propped up his sagging bottom line. Monthly credit card receipts, reported to the I.R.S. by third-party card processing firms, reflect the way certain of his resorts, golf courses and hotels became favored stomping grounds, if not venues for influence-trading, beginning in 2015 and continuing into his time in the White House.\\nThe credit card data does not reflect total revenue, and is useful mainly for showing short-term ups and downs of consumer interest in a business. While two of Mr. Trump’s marquee draws — the Washington hotel in the Old Post Office and the Doral golf resort — are loaded with debt and continue to lose money, both have seen credit card transactions rise markedly with his political ascent.\\nThough the Trump International Hotel in Washington is loaded with debt and losing money, its credit card transactions have risen with Mr. Trump’s political ascent. Al Drago for The New York Times\\nAt the hotel, the monthly receipts grew from $3.7 million in December 2016 shortly after it opened, to $5.4 million in January 2017 and $6 million by May 2018. At Doral, after Mr. Trump declared his candidacy in June 2015, credit card revenue more than doubled, to $13 million, for the three months through August, compared with the same period the year before.\\nOne Trump enterprise that has been regularly profitable, and is a persistent source of concern about ethical conflicts and national security lapses, is the Mar-a-Lago club. Profits there rose sharply after Mr. Trump declared his candidacy, as courtiers eagerly joining up brought a tenfold rise in cash from initiation fees — from $664,000 in 2014 to just under $6 million in 2016, even before Mr. Trump doubled the cost of initiation in January 2017. The membership rush allowed the president to take $26 million out of the business from 2015 through 2018, nearly triple the rate at which he had paid himself in the prior two years.\\nSome of the largest payments from business groups for events or conferences at Mar-a-Lago and other Trump properties have come since Mr. Trump became president, the tax records show.\\nAt Doral, Mr. Trump collected a total of at least $7 million in 2015 and 2016 from Bank of America, and at least $1.2 million in 2017 and 2018 from a trade association representing food retailers and wholesalers. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce paid Doral at least $406,599 in 2018.\\nBeyond one-time payments for events or memberships, large corporations also pay rent for space in the few commercial buildings Mr. Trump actually owns. Walgreens, the pharmacy giant that resolved an antitrust matter before federal regulators in 2017, pays $3.4 million a year for a lease at 40 Wall Street, a Trump-owned office building in Manhattan.\\nAnother renter at 40 Wall, for $2.5 million a year, is Atane Engineers, which changed its name in 2018 after a corruption scandal that culminated in two former top executives’ pleading guilty to paying bribes for city infrastructure contracts. Despite the criminal case — which landed the company on New York State’s list of “non-responsible entities” that require a waiver to obtain state contracts — the newly christened Atane registered as an eligible federal contractor with no restrictions listed in its file.\\nRental income over all at 40 Wall has risen markedly, from $30.5 million in 2014 to $43.2 million in 2018. The tax records show that the cost of existing leases there has risen, and at least four law firms appear to have moved in since Mr. Trump ran for president.\\nMr. Trump has a 30 percent stake in two valuable office towers, including one in Midtown Manhattan, shared with and managed by Vornado Realty Trust. Dave Sanders for The New York Times The other tower, in San Francisco, co-owned with Vornado, whose C.E.O. is a Trump ally and whose tenants include firms that lobby the federal government. Jim Wilson/The New York Times\\nIn addition to buildings he owns outright, there is the president’s stake in the Vornado partnerships that control two valuable office towers — 1290 Sixth Avenue in Manhattan and 555 California Street in San Francisco. Vornado’s chief executive, Steven Roth, is a close Trump ally recently named to the White House economic recovery council. Last year, the president appointed Mr. Roth’s wife, Daryl Roth, to the Kennedy Center board of trustees.\\nVornado tenants include a roster of blue-chip firms paying multimillion-dollar leases, many of whom regularly do business with, lobby or are regulated by the federal government. Among the dozens of leases paid in 2018 to Mr. Trump’s Vornado partnerships, according to his tax records, were $5.8 million from Goldman Sachs; $3.1 million from Microsoft; $32.7 million from Neuberger Berman, an investment management company; and $8.8 million from the law firm Kirkland & Ellis.\\nThe Gathering Storm\\nThreats are converging: mounting business losses, the looming I.R.S. audit and personally guaranteed debts coming due.\\nWhen Mr. Trump glided down a gilded Trump Tower escalator to kick off his presidential campaign in June 2015, his finances needed a jolt.\\nHis core businesses were reporting mounting losses — more than $100 million over the previous two years. The river of celebrity-driven income that had long buoyed them was running dry.\\nIf Mr. Trump hoped his unlikely candidacy might, at least, revitalize his brand, his barrage of derogatory remarks about immigrants quickly cost him two of his biggest and easiest sources of cash — licensing deals with clothing and mattress manufacturers that had netted him more than $30 million. NBC, his partner in Miss Universe — source of nearly $20 million in profits — announced that it would no longer broadcast the pageant; he sold it soon after.\\nNow his tax records make clear that he is facing a battery of threats to his business and his own financial well-being.\\nOver the past decade, he appears to have filled the cash-flow gaps with a series of one-shots that may not be available again.\\nIn 2012, he took out a $100 million mortgage on the commercial space in Trump Tower. He took nearly the entire amount as a payout, his tax records show. His company has paid more than $15 million in interest on the loan, but nothing on the principal. The full $100 million comes due in 2022.\\nIn 2013, he withdrew $95.8 million from his Vornado partnership account.\\nAnd in January 2014, he sold $98 million in stocks and bonds, his biggest single month of sales in at least the last two decades. He sold $54 million more in stocks and bonds in 2015, and $68.2 million in 2016. His financial disclosure released in July showed that he had as little as $873,000 in securities left to sell.\\nMr. Trump’s businesses reported cash on hand of $34.7 million in 2018, down 40 percent from five years earlier.\\nWhat’s more, the tax records show that Mr. Trump has once again done what he says he regrets, looking back on his early 1990s meltdown: personally guaranteed hundreds of millions of dollars in loans, a decision that led his lenders to threaten to force him into personal bankruptcy.\\nThis time around, he is personally responsible for loans and other debts totaling $421 million, with most of it coming due within four years. Should he win re-election, his lenders could be placed in the unprecedented position of weighing whether to foreclose on a sitting president.\\nThere is, however, a tax benefit for Mr. Trump. While business owners can use losses to avoid taxes, they can do so only up to the amount invested in the business. But by taking personal responsibility for that $421 million in debt, Mr. Trump would be able to declare that amount in losses in future years.\\nThe balances on those loans had not been paid down by the end of 2018. And the businesses carrying the bulk of the debt — the Doral golf resort ($125 million) and the Washington hotel ($160 million) — are struggling, which could make it difficult to find a lender willing to refinance it.\\nThe unresolved audit of his $72.9 million tax refund hangs over his head.\\nThe broader economy promises little relief. Across the country, brick-and-mortar stores are in decline, and they have been very important to Trump Tower, which has in turn been very important to Mr. Trump. Nike, which rented the space for its flagship store in a building attached to Trump Tower and had paid $195.1 million in rent since the 1990s, left in 2018.\\nThe president’s most recent financial disclosure reported modest gains in 2019. But that was before the pandemic hit. His already struggling properties were shut down for several months earlier this year. The Doral resort asked Deutsche Bank to allow a delay on its loan payments. Analysts have predicted that the hotel business will not fully recover until late 2023.\\nMr. Trump still has assets to sell. But doing so could take its own toll, both financial and to Mr. Trump’s desire to always be seen as a winner. The Trump family said last year that it was considering selling the Washington hotel, but not because it was losing money.\\nIn Mr. Trump’s telling, any difficulty in his finances has been caused by the sacrifices made for his current job.\\n“They say, ‘Trump is getting rich off our nation,’” he said at a rally in Minneapolis last October. “I lose billions being president, and I don’t care. It’s nice to be rich, I guess, but I lose billions.”\\nDavid Kirkpatrick, Kitty Bennett and Jesse Drucker contributed reporting.

Barr entered office with more credibility than many Trump appointees. A veteran of the George H.W. Bush administration, Mr. Barr avowed loyalty to the Justice Department’s mission and, nearing the end of his career, seemed to have little incentive to serve as another Trump sycophant. Yet Mr. Barr has lit his reputation on fire, and he just added more fuel during his Wednesday testimony before a Senate panel.\\nMuch of the hearing centered on the attorney general’s decision to release a highly misleading representation of the findings of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s Russia investigation. In particular, Mr. Barr failed to acknowledge the alarming nature of Mr. Mueller’s analysis on whether President Trump obstructed justice, and he did not explain why the special counsel declined to say whether Mr. Trump was guilty of the charge. This really matters: Given the damning account in Mr. Mueller’s report, what appeared to be keeping the special counsel from accusing the president of criminal acts was not the lack of evidence but the fact that the president cannot be charged under Justice Department rules.\\nMr. Barr defended himself Wednesday by insisting that his memo, publicized weeks before he released any additional material, was technically accurate, despite the fact that his spin deeply affected the reception of Mr. Mueller’s full report when the public finally got it. It was not supposed to be a full summary of the special counsel’s report, he insisted — just a brief explanation of the top-line conclusions. Mr. Barr’s long history in Washington belies his argument: He should have known how his pre-spinning of the Mueller report would distort the truth of the special counsel’s damning findings to the president’s benefit. He did it anyway.\\nAdvertisement\\nAmerican journalist Austin Tice is missing in Syria. It's time to bring him home. (Video: Kate Woodsome, Joshua Carroll, Danielle Kunitz/The Washington Post)\\nThe Post revealed Tuesday that, shortly after Mr. Barr released his memo, Mr. Mueller sent a letter to the attorney general, objecting that the memo “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of the special counsel’s report. Mr. Barr did not mention this letter when he told members of Congress last month that he had no knowledge of any frustration on the part of Mr. Mueller’s staff. In other words, after releasing a spin job on the Mueller report, he misled Congress on whether the special counsel was unhappy about it.\\nFollow Editorial Board 's opinions Follow\\nOn this and other matters, Mr. Barr has cited personal conversations with Mr. Mueller to defend his actions. According to Mr. Barr, the special counsel was more unhappy with the media coverage of the attorney general’s memo than with the memo itself. Mr. Barr also insisted that Mr. Mueller said Justice Department policy on charging sitting presidents did not determine his decision on accusing Mr. Trump of a crime — even though that was a key consideration in the analysis Mr. Mueller included in his report.\\nIt is long past time the public stopped hearing Mr. Barr’s views on how Mr. Mueller feels, and heard from the special counsel himself. The Justice Department should enable Mr. Mueller to speak publicly and under oath at the earliest opportunity. The special counsel should address not only his substantive findings on the president’s misbehavior but also the attorney general’s manipulation of his work. Not just Mr. Trump should be held accountable for his actions.

And there is simply no recent evidence that points to Congress coming to a deal, throwing into doubt the deportation protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the country as children.\\nSince passing a comprehensive immigration overhaul in 2013 that was ignored by the House, the Senate has been unable to get 60 votes for a substantial immigration bill. The chamber did pass a spending bill delivering aid to the border this year, but Democrats battled one another so fiercely over the matter that it made the party only more skittish to deal with the Trump administration.\\nPerhaps the biggest hurdle is the massive trust deficit between Senate Democrats and the president. They feel so burned by past negotiations — on transportation, gun safety and immigration reform, among the issues — that many in the party seem not to have it in them to try again.\\n“It is exceptionally difficult to make any deal that sticks. For a man who is supposed to be a great deal-maker, we have yet to see a great deal,” centrist Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said.\\nCoons said when he tries to reengage Democrats on immigration, they remind him of the 2018 debacle, when the president rejected a bill that would have provided a massive $25 billion for border security in return for protecting DACA recipients and their parents. That bill failed 54-45, and the president’s plan to cut legal immigration in addition to dealing with DACA and the border wall fared even worse, dying 39-60.\\nTrump tweeted this week: “If Supreme Court remedies with overturn, a deal will be made with Dems for them to stay!”\\nBut Democrats aren’t the only ones who are skeptical of the president’s negotiating style on immigration.\\nJust eight Republicans joined the Democrats on the compromise immigration proposal in 2018, a number advocates say could have been much higher without Trump and his aides intervening to oppose it.\\n“The night before it had 60. … And overnight we lost six Republicans,” said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). “I read different things and hear different things that [Trump] is actually sympathetic to the DACA population. But he’s obviously under pressure from hardliners like Stephen Miller to do the wrong thing.”\\nA White House official said the administration opposed the bipartisan immigration plan because it relied on future Congresses to actually deliver the money for the border and would hamper the executive branch’s immigration enforcement priorities.\\nThough the House passed legislation dealing with DACA protections earlier this year, the Senate has ignored it. And on legislation, the bar is so much higher in the Senate, with its 60-vote requirement. Under the current party splits, the chamber’s supermajority threshold on the filibuster would require either seven Democrats or 13 Republicans to cross party lines on any immigration bill.\\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) put it simply: “We don’t have the votes in the Senate, OK?”\\n“I truly believe in my heart of hearts that the president liked the 2013 immigration reform. … His staff around him and the base will not let him go there,” Manchin said. “It hasn’t happened, and it doesn’t look like it’s going to happen. And that’s a shame.”\\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., center, accompanied by Venezuelan opposition's new envoy in Washington Carlos Vecchio, left, Chairman Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, and Sen.

Trump lost 14 votes from the Senate GOP on his 2018 immigration bill, revealing that any legislation providing a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants is a bridge too far for some Republicans.\\nThat said, the GOP still remains generally sympathetic to the DACA population and McConnell said earlier this year he’d like to take up immigration. Some senators said the chamber should begin working on a plan now rather than wait for the Supreme Court to force Congress’ hands just months from a presidential election.\\n“If they strike it down there’s going to be chaos,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). “It would be unfair to a lot of these young people who have done nothing wrong. And I’m going to see if we can find a way to head that off.”\\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a supporter of the 2013 comprehensive immigration bill, said Congress’ best hope of success is narrowing legislation as much as it possibly can to cover only the 660,000 young people whose status could be thrown into uncertainty.\\n“It’s important to remind everybody that the president offered a bill that dealt with Dreamers. ... Where it got tangled up is Democrats insisted that it also include their parents,” Rubio said. “The challenge here on immigration at large is that any limited bill is never enough. People want to tag more stuff on it and that’s what weighs it down.”\\nYet this time, there’s more than the typical number of hurdles. Lawmakers’ primary legislative objective is to fund the government, a task that’s proving exceedingly difficult. And impeachment is bearing down on the Capitol, with a trial likely to paralyze the Senate for weeks and make tackling other legislation even more difficult.\\nNot to mention that the Democratic presidential primary is heating up, and the general election will be in full swing when the Supreme Court decides whether to let Trump terminate President Barack Obama’s executive action protecting the immigrants. Trump has campaigned as an immigration hard-liner, and a pivot to the middle would surprise most everyone in Washington.\\nStill, the biggest problem might be getting votes from Democrats for any plan that doesn’t first have Trump’s full and explicit support.\\nThe bipartisan immigration deal cut by Sens. Angus King (I-Maine) and Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) last year got the vote of every Democrat but three. And King says he couldn’t replicate that today after Trump torpedoed it.\\n“We had a bill, he could have his whole wall and DACA would have been fixed and he killed it,” said King, who caucuses with the Democrats. “It was one of the toughest [caucus meetings] I’ve ever been in to get the votes for that compromise.

(Senate Television via AP)\\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Lawyers for Donald Trump stretched beyond the facts when they argued there’s an open-and-shut case that the Constitution bars impeaching former presidents. That question is not settled, though the weight of legal views contradicts the Trump team’s assertions.\\nBruce Castor and David Schoen addressed the Senate Tuesday on the first day of Trump’s trial after Democratic impeachment managers from the House presented the opening of their case for conviction. Trump is accused of inciting the deadly siege on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nDemocrats overcame a procedural hurdle as the Senate voted 56-44 to proceed with trial but face tough odds trying to win the two-thirds majority needed to convict Trump.\\nA look at the arguments:\\nCASTOR, quoting the Constitution: ”‘Judgment in cases of impeachment’ — i.e., what we are doing — ‘shall not extend further than to removal from office.’ What is so hard about that? Which of those words are unclear? ... President Trump is no longer in office. The object of the Constitution has been achieved. He was removed by the voters.”\\nTHE FACTS: Castor ignored the Constitution’s full passage on this matter in the conclusion of his opening remarks. The Constitution goes on to provide another legitimate consequence of impeachment: “Disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.”\\nDemocrats argue that the purpose of impeaching an ex-president, who can no longer be removed from office because he has left it, is to hold him accountable for the insurrection and to seek to bar him from holding future office.\\nCastor gave the fuller flavor of the passage earlier in his remarks but ignored the matter of future disqualification in summing up his argument.\\n___\\nSCHOEN, on trying an ex-president on an impeachment charge: “You bought into a radical constitutional theory. ... This is an affront to the Constitution.”\\nTHE FACTS: While Trump is indeed the first president to be tried after leaving office, making it new legal territory, it’s not a “radical” concept in legal circles.\\nNothing in the Constitution explicitly bars an impeachment trial for an official no longer in office, and there is precedent for doing so with the 1876 impeachment trial of Secretary of War William W. Belknap, who was tried and acquitted even after he had resigned his office.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nBelknap resigned before he was impeached, but the Senate still asserted its right to hold a trial, though it ultimately failed to convict him on a two-thirds vote. In contrast, Trump was impeached while still in office; only his Senate trial came after.\\nThe U.S. government’s Congressional Research Service, in a Jan. 15 report , said: “Though the text is open to debate, it appears that most scholars who have closely examined the question have concluded that Congress has authority to extend the impeachment process to officials who are no longer in office.”\\nThe Constitution doesn’t mention convicting an ex-president. It only says the president and other officers shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery or “high crimes and misdemeanors.”\\nCharles J. Cooper, a prominent conservative constitutional scholar, said in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that “it defies logic to suggest that the Senate is prohibited from trying and convicting former officeholders.”\\nHarvard Law professor Laurence H. Tribe and others also have written that the Constitution clearly envisioned trying ex-presidents in a Senate impeachment trial. “Concluding otherwise would all but erase the disqualification power from the Constitution’s text,” he wrote in The Washington Post.\\nIf Democrats summon enough votes to convict Trump — 67 — the ex-president could then be barred from future office with a simple majority of 51 votes in the Senate.\\n___\\nCASTOR, referring to the constitutional standard of “high crimes and misdemeanors” for impeaching a president: “A high crime is a felony and a misdemeanor is a misdemeanor. The words haven’t changed that much over time.”\\nTHE FACTS: That’s not right. A misdemeanor referred to by the Constitution does not resemble a mere infraction that falls short of a felony, as misdemeanors and felonies are understood in the justice system today.\\nConstitutional scholars say the “high crimes and misdemeanors” catch-all was intended by the framers to make clear that impeachment could be aimed at any consequential abuse of power so long as that abuse hurt the country at large.\\nAnd they say the standard was “high” misdemeanors as well as high crimes, with the founders seeing no need to repeat the adjective.\\nThe term is considered open-ended because, like other constitutional provisions, it was intended to last long beyond the lives of the designers of the Constitution, Georgia State University law professor Neil Kinkopf wrote on the bipartisan National Constitution Center’s website.\\n___\\nEDITOR’S NOTE — A look at the veracity of claims by political figures.\\n___\\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apnews.com/APFactCheck\\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck'], 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/rnc-2020-melania-trump-mike-pompeo-to-make-case-for-trump-on-night-two-11598383540?mod=hp_lead_pos5': ['wsj.com', 'RNC 2020: Melania Trump, Mike Pompeo Buck Tradition With Convention Speeches', 'Alex Leary', datetime.datetime(2020, 8, 25, 19, 25), 'First lady Melania Trump argued for her husband’s re-election from the White House grounds, saying he was fighting for Americans, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo weighed in from Jerusalem, as the second night of the Republican convention entered unusual territory for a political event.\\nThe speeches capped a night of programming that carried made-for-TV flourishes that upended norms for a convention, including videos of President Trump issuing a pardon and conducting a naturalization ceremony from the White House.

He argues that it is the job of the public, not journalists, to make this type of characterization. Read his opinion piece, below. (NPR\\'s newsroom has not changed its view on this issue and will continue referring to President Trump\\'s tweet as racist. )\\nOnce again, the president of the United States has used the sniper tower of Twitter to take aim at immigration, race relations and common decency. And once again, journalists are daring their profession to boldly call bigotry what it is: bigotry. Enough of the vacuous \"racially charged,\" \"racially loaded,\" \"racially insensitive\" evasions, they say. It\\'s racist, and we should just call it that.\\nI understand the moral outrage behind wanting to slap this particular label on this particular president and his many incendiary utterances, but I disagree. Journalism may not have come honorably to the conclusion that dispassionate distance is a virtue. But that\\'s the fragile line that separates the profession from the rancid, institution-debasing cesspool that is today\\'s politics.\\nIt is precisely because journalism is given to warm-spit phrases like \"racially insensitive\" and \"racially charged\" that we should not be in the business of moral labeling in the first place. Who decides where the line is that the president crossed? The headline writer working today who thinks it\\'s \"insensitive\" or the one tomorrow who thinks it\\'s \"racist?\" Were we to use my moral standards, the line for calling people and words racist in this country would have been crossed decades ago. But that\\'s not what journalists do. We report and interview and attribute.\\nI am not a journalism purist. I came into the profession 40 years ago to tear down the spurious notion of objectivity used to protect a legacy of sexism, xenophobia and white supremacy. The better ideals of truth telling, accountability, fairness, etc. are what give journalism its power, while the notion of \"objectivity\" has been used to obscure and excuse the insidious biases we do battle with today.\\nI\\'ve been an informed consumer of the media since my days as a paperboy. I read the Times-Picayune as I delivered it, and the distorted view it offered of black and poor New Orleans told me all I needed to know about \"objectivity.\" We have come miles since then as a profession. But why should I trust that we\\'re all on the same page with our labels now? Weren\\'t last week\\'s tweets racist? Or last year\\'s? Weren\\'t some misogynistic? Vulgar? Homophobic? Sexist? The language of my judgment is generous, and they are my opinion, and they belong in the space reserved for opinions.\\nWhat\\'s at stake is journalism\\'s embattled claim to be the source of credible news grounded in the kind of deep, fair reporting that exposes injustice and holds powerful people to account. It may be satisfying to call the president\\'s words, or the president himself, racist, given the attacks tweeted from his bully app and so often aimed at our profession. But at what cost?\\nIt\\'s already nearly impossible to separate actual journalism from the argumentative noise on the cable networks that dominate so much of public perception. There are already too many journalists dancing day and night on the line that once separated fact and judgment. When that line is finally obliterated and we sink into the cesspool beckoning us to its depths, this historically flawed, imperfect tool for revealing and routing racism will look and sound indistinguishable from the noise and become just as irrelevant.\\nOn Sunday, the president tweeted this:\\n\"So interesting to see \\'Progressive\\' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run. Why don\\'t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\"\\nHis words mirror those of avowed racists and xenophobes that date back to the birth of this country. Was that moral judgment, my last sentence? I would argue no. I\\'d call it context, and it doesn\\'t require my opinion, just a basic understanding of history. That\\'s an alternative to labels: Report. Quote people. Cite sources. Add context.

The 5th Circuit’s ruling and the Supreme Court’s subsequent affirmance provide a sufficient rationale for ending DACA, which is largely similar to DAPA, Roberts suggested.\\n“You’ve got a court of appeals decision affirmed by an equally-divided Supreme Court,” Roberts said, in reference to the earlier DAPA case. “Can’t he just say that’s the basis on which I’m making this decision?”\\nApart from concerns about DACA’s legality, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) identified independent policy reasons for ending the program. He repeatedly challenged lawyers representing left-leaning states and civil rights groups to describe why the government’s explanation for its decision fell short. (RELATED: American Hero Fights Traffic Stop All The Way To The Supreme Court)\\nThe Trump administration rescinds DACA\\nDACA does not confer lawful status on recipients, nor is it a defense against deportation. Instead, if delays removal for a renewable two-year period and allows beneficiaries to apply for work permits. Former President Barack Obama established the program in 2012. To qualify, recipients must have entered the country unlawfully before age 16, show five years of continuous residence in the U.S., graduate high school, serve in the Armed Forces, or enroll in school.\\nDHS oversees the DACA program. There are approximately 700,000 so-called “Dreamers” as of this writing. California is home to the largest number of DACA beneficiaries according to U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services (USCIS), with approximately 190,000 recipients. Texas follows at about 110,000.\\nThough initially established as a stopgap measure, the policy enjoys broad, bipartisan support. The president has repeatedly expressed reluctance to end DACA. Yet a decision from the high court authorizing its termination would give Trump significant leverage in negotiations with Congress over an immigration deal. Trump alluded to such an outcome in a September tweet.\\nDACA will be going before the Supreme Court. It is a document that even President Obama didn’t feel he had the legal right to sign – he signed it anyway! Rest assured that if the SC does what all say it must, based on the law, a bipartisan deal will be made to the benefit of all! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2019\\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke set a timeline for DACA’s termination in September 2017. In a memo explaining her decision, Duke said then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions told DHS that the program is unlawful. She further noted that a coalition of states was threatening to sue the federal government over DACA in view of the 5th Circuit’s DAPA decision.\\nDuke’s memo prompted a flurry of litigation. Federal trial judges in California, New York, and Washington, D.C., blocked the order on a nationwide basis. Neither the plaintiffs nor the lower courts believe Trump lacks the power to terminate DACA. Instead, the challengers say Duke’s memo is “arbitrary and capricious” under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and must be set aside.\\nThe APA requires that the government provide clear, reasoned explanations for new policy. The plaintiffs argue Duke’s memo is a “superficial explanation” that “fails to explain the Acting Secretary’s reasoning,” and thus violates the APA. The challengers say a second memo former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen issued on DACA’s termination in June 2018 is similarly deficient.\\n“It is truly remarkable that a Cabinet-level officer would offer such a cursory explanation for a decision that affects hundreds of thousands of lives and reverses a longstanding and carefully-reasoned government position,” the plaintiffs told the high court in legal briefs. “The APA requires more.”\\nBefore Supreme Court, disputes over reviewability, fate of “Dreamers”\\nThe Trump administration argues its decision to cancel DACA is not subject to APA arbitrary and capricious review in court. That’s because the APA doesn’t apply to actions “committed to agency discretion by law.” Rescinding a non-enforcement policy like DACA is a “quintessential” example of agency discretion, the government said in legal filings, much like a prosecutor’s decision to pursue or decline indictments. The government’s discretion is especially powerful in the immigration area, the administration adds.\\nJustice Samuel Alito seemed to agree with those propositions. He compared the DACA dispute to a case involving a hypothetical Justice Department decision not to prosecute cases of cocaine possession below certain amounts. Ted Olson, a lawyer challenging DACA’s termination, agreed Alito’s cocaine example could not be challenged in court.\\n“Well, what’s the difference?” Alito shot back. Justice Neil Gorsuch expressed similar doubts.\\nEven if its decision can be reviewed in court, the administration says the Duke and Nielsen memos give ample grounds for ending DACA that the courts must accept. The left-leaning justices were particularly dubious of that claim, saying those materials did not address real-world consequences in a meaningful way. Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointedly accused the government of blaming the law to dodge political heat.\\n“There’s a whole lot of reliance interests that weren’t looked at, including the current president telling DACA-eligible people that they were safe under him and that he would find a way to keep them here,” Sotomayor told Solicitor General Noel Francisco.\\n“Where is all of this really considered and weighed?” she added. “Where is the political decision made clearly, that this is not about the law, this is about our choice to destroy lives.”\\n“We own this,” Francisco said in reply. (RELATED: Supreme Court Hears Aaaarguments Over Blackbeard’s Pirate Wreck)\\nJustice Stephen Breyer referenced numerous amicus (or “friend of the court”) briefs from businesses, labor unions, and religious organizations describing the benefits DACA recipients provide their organizations. Breyer said the Duke and Nielsen documents didn’t seem “to take into account that broad range of interests.”\\n“There are 66 healthcare organizations,” Breyer told Francisco. “There are three labor unions. There are 210 educational associations. There are six military organizations. There are three home builders, five states plus those involved, 108, I think, municipalities and cities, 129 religious organizations, and 145 businesses.”\\nThough Gorsuch was broadly sympathetic to the administration, at one point he telegraphed a possible compromise. He asked Francisco if the justices should send the case back to the lower courts and give the administration a chance to offer a more detailed rationale for its decision.\\n“Given the extent of the reliance interests and the size of the class, more needed to be said, more could be said, and it wouldn’t be a huge burden to require the government on remand to say more,” Gorsuch said, summarizing the plaintiffs’s views.\\nKavanaugh countered that a federal trial court in Washington, D.C. did just that at an earlier phase of the litigation. Nielsen produced her June 2018 memo at the direction of U.S. District Judge John Bates, who found the Duke’s directive wanting. As such, Kavanaugh questioned the value of an additional remand.\\n“There’s already been, in effect, a remand,” Kavanaugh said.\\nThe Mexican government and a coalition of big businesses are urging the justices to maintain DACA.

It proved to be illuminating.\\nAs is often the case, the first question was the most penetrating and important one. It got to the heart of the Democrats’ principal accusation regarding why they contend the president should be removed from office.\\nDemocrats claim that when Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into what Trump called troubling actions by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, Trump was seeking a political advantage against a prospective opponent in the November presidential election. This, argue Democrats, was an impeachable “abuse of power,” and was the basis of the first article of impeachment approved by House Democrats in December.\\n'GAME OVER,' TRUMP DECLARES, AS OLD BOLTON, SCHIFF VIDEOS SURFACE AMID IMPEACHMENT TRIAL\\nTrump’s legal team has countered that the president had every right to ask Ukraine to examine and produce any evidence of a potentially corrupt act by a U.S. public official. The act to be examined was Joe Biden’s demand that Ukraine fire a prosecutor who was allegedly investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company that employed his son.\\nBy any reasonable and objective standard, Hunter Biden’s employment was highly suspicious and unusual. At a time when his father was serving as vice president and in charge of Ukraine policy for the Obama-Biden administration, Hunter Biden was being paid $83,000 a month to sit on the natural gas company’s board – despite having absolutely no experience in the energy sector and no experience in Ukrainian affairs.\\nThe question put to Trump’s defense team by Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah was: “If President Trump had more than one motive for his alleged conduct such as the pursuit of personal political advantage, rooting out corruption and the promotion of national interest, how should the Senate consider more than one motive in its assessment of Article 1?”\\nMore than any other question, this one needed answering. Setting aside whether Trump was genuinely motivated by electoral gain, Deputy White House Counsel Patrick Philbin explained that presidents often make decisions that have multiple or “mixed motives.” This is an obvious truth.\\nAs I argued in my last column, nearly all presidential actions involve some ancillary political calculation. Sometimes there is a dual or overlapping purpose.\\nHistory is replete with examples of how presidents, including Abraham Lincoln, have rendered decisions that benefited themselves and the nation simultaneously. This does not mean their judgments constituted an abuse of power. If it were otherwise, nearly all presidents would be impeached and evicted from office.\\nPhilbin reasoned that all elected officials are mindful of how their conduct will affect their political standing because “there’s always some personal interest in the electoral outcome of policy decisions.”\\nIn asking President Zelensky to look into then-Vice President Biden’s threat to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid from Ukraine unless the prosecutor allegedly investigating Burisma was fired, Philbin explained that Trump had a legitimate public purpose.\\n“If there were a motive that was of public interest, but also some personal interest, it follows more clearly that it cannot possibly be the basis for an impeachable offense,” Philbin said. He added that “lots of their own witnesses from the State Department said that, on its face, it (Joe Biden’s actions) appeared to be a conflict of interest.”\\nConstitutional law professor Alan Dershowitz was even more animated in defense of the multiple motives argument when he spoke in President Trump’s defense at the impeachment trial.\\n“Every public official that I know believes that his election is in the public interest,” Dershowitz said. “And, mostly, you’re right. Your election is in the public interest. And if a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.”\\nDershowitz again cited the example of President Lincoln, who encouraged General William T. Sherman to grant his men leave from the battlefield to return to Indiana to cast votes for Lincoln’s reelection in 1864.\\nDid Lincoln use the power of his office for personal and/or political gain? Of course, he did. Was it an impeachable “abuse of power?” No, said Dershowitz, “because the president believed it was in the national interest. He believed that his own reelection was essential to victory in the Civil War.”\\nThe retired Harvard Law School professor added: “Everybody has mixed motives, and for there to be a constitutional impeachment based on mixed motives would permit almost any president to be impeached. How many presidents have made foreign policy decisions after checking with their political advisers and their pollsters? If you’re just acting in the national interest, why do you need pollsters? Why do you need political advisers? Just do what’s best for the country.”\\nDershowitz tied his constitutional analysis together by stating: “For it to be impeachable, you would have to discern that he [the president] made a decision solely on the basis of, as the House managers have put it, a corrupt motive and it cannot be a corrupt motive if you have a mixed motive that partially involves the national interest and partially involves electoral interests.”\\nOnly an unlawful act by the president would be impeachable, Dershowitz concluded. Yet, House managers have not alleged a crime or violation of the law in their articles of impeachment.\\nThe defense argument – blending history, precedent and common sense – renders the prospect of the Senate calling new witnesses, such as former National Security Adviser John Bolton, superfluous.\\nFor the sake of argument, let’s assume – as The New York Times has reported – that Bolton’s upcoming book recounts how Trump mentioned in a conversation that he “wanted” to withhold $391 million in U.S. security assistance from Ukraine unless that nation investigated the Bidens. Let’s further assume that Trump’s motive was, in part, political.\\nThis still does not meet the proper impeachable standard for several reasons.\\nFirst, can anyone truly argue that the behavior of the Bidens was not suspicious enough to merit an investigation? Democrats’ own witnesses said it posed a serious conflict of interest. Evidence produced by Republicans during the Trump impeachment trial has raised the specter of influence peddling and self-enrichment.\\nVideo clips were played of the media asking persistent questions regarding the Bidens and airing stories suggestive of corruption. This demonstrates that President Trump had a legitimate basis to ask Ukraine to scrutinize what happened. It was a matter of public interest.\\nEven accepting that the leaked story about the Bolton book is accurate, a president wanting to do something and actually doing it are two very different concepts. Lots of presidents want to do things they never choose to do.\\nAfter delaying U.S. military aid to Ukraine, Trump released the funds to the nation without any strings attached. No “quid pro quo” ever came to fruition. The idea – if there ever was one – was discarded.\\nImportantly, President Zelensky and his foreign minister both stated they were never pressured to investigate anything and had no idea that American aid was temporarily halted until well after the fact.\\nPresident Trump may have talked with Bolton about conditioning aid to Ukraine on an investigation of the Bidens, but such action never occurred. To remove Trump from office for merely discussing something with a senior aide is to turn Congress into the “thought police” where contemplation is tantamount to an impeachable offense.\\nFinally, there’s the matter of Bolton’s suspected breach of confidential communications with Trump and the disclosure of classified material. Presidents have the right to obtain confidential advice and to engage in private deliberations without the intrusion of the legislative branch.\\nThe principle of executive privilege has been recognized and respected since President George Washington invoked it more than two centuries ago. It is a paramount privilege when matters of national security are at stake. Trump’s conversation with his national security adviser is most likely covered by the privilege.\\nIt is deeply disturbing that Bolton would have the temerity to write a book that would breach this privilege and profit by it financially.\\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\\nThree days before The New York Times reported its story based on (you guessed it) anonymous sources, a senior director at the National Security Council sent a letter to Bolton’s lawyer. The letter warned that the manuscript submitted to the council contains “significant amounts of classified information,” including some “at the TOP SECRET level.”\\nUnder federal law, and perhaps as well as under the nondisclosure agreement that Bolton signed as a condition to his employment, publication of the existing manuscript could subject him to criminal charges.\\nThe Times reports that Bolton has already circulated his book manuscript to “close associates” – something Bolton denies doing. If the newspaper report is correct and those individuals did not have the highest security clearance, the law may already have been broken.\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\nWhoever leaked to the Times could also be prosecuted if the information conveyed was deemed classified. Regardless of the security issues, senators are still not entitled to pierce the veil of executive privilege unless Trump waives the privilege or the federal courts determine that it does not apply.\\nIs it really worth a protracted legal battle for the Senate to gain access to a purported presidential discussion of a “quid pro quo” that, in the end, never actually happened?

It sure looks that way based on recent search results for news on the president.\\nConservatives and Trump supporters have for the last several years questioned whether Google was deprioritizing conservative news sites, hiding them from users who utilize their search engine. Google has maintained that all outlets are treated fairly, but nevertheless, conservative sites have reported reduced search traffic and, in the case of Google-owned YouTube, content creators have been banned and demonetized. Google’s high-profile firing of conservative James Damore, purportedly over his conservative political views, only reinforces the idea that Google is picking winners and losers.\\nTo test the premise, I performed a Google search for “Trump” using the search engine’s “News” tab and analyzed the results using Sharyl Attkisson’s media bias chart.\\nI expected to see some skewing of the results based on my extensive experience with Google, but I was not prepared for the blatant prioritization of left-leaning and anti-Trump media outlets. Looking at the first page of search results, I discovered that CNN was the big winner, scoring two of the first ten results. Other left-leaning sites that appeared on the first page were CBS, The Atlantic, CNBC, The New Yorker, Politico, Reuters, and USA Today (the last two outlets on this list could arguably be considered more centrist than the others).\\nNot a single right-leaning site appeared on the first page of search results.\\nBut it got much, much worse when I analyzed the first 100 items that Google returned in a search for news on “Trump.”\\nCNN, by a wide margin, appeared most frequently, with nearly twice as many results returned as the second-place finisher, The Washington Post. Other left-leaning outlets also fared well, including NBC, CNBC, The Atlantic, and Politico. The only right-leaning sites to appear in the top 100 were The Wall Street Journal and Fox News with 3 and 2 results respectively.\\nPJ Media did not appear in the first 100 results, nor did National Review, The Weekly Standard, Breitbart, The Blaze, The Daily Wire, Hot Air, Townhall, Red State, or any other conservative-leaning sites except the two listed above.\\nHere are the sites that appeared most frequently in the top 100 results.\\nAs you can see, CNN has a disproportionate number of articles returned when searching for “Trump” — nearly 29 percent of the total. In fact, left-leaning sites comprised 96 percent of the total results.\\nI performed the search a multiple times using different computers (registered to different users) and Google returned similar results. While not scientific, the results suggest a pattern of bias against right-leaning content.\\nGoogle is secretive about its algorithm, although the company does say that a variety of factors — around 200 of them, according to Google — go into how pages are ranked. In fact, a whole science has developed — called search engine optimization (SEO) — that purports to help sites become more visible in Google search results. Factors such as the relevance of the topic, the design of the website, internal and external links, and the way articles are written and formatted all can affect a site’s Google traffic. Google is constantly tweaking their algorithm, and a website’s traffic prospects can rise or fall depending on the changes. PJ Media’s Google search traffic, for example, dropped precipitously after a May 2017 algorithm change. We have yet to recover the lost traffic. Other conservative sites have reported similar drops in traffic.\\n“Can I Rank,” an SEO company in San Francisco, also found an anti-conservative bias in Google search results. The company studied over 1,200 URLs that ranked highly in Google search results for politically-charged keywords like “gun control,” “abortion,” “TPP,” and Black Lives Matter” and then assessed whether there was a political slant to the articles.\\n“Among our key findings were that top search results were almost 40% more likely to contain pages with a ‘Left’ or ‘Far Left’ slant than they were pages from the right,” Can I Rank found. “Moreover, 16% of political keywords contained no right-leaning pages at all within the first page of results.”\\nThey sampled 2,000 results and found that searchers are 39 percent more likely to be presented with left-leaning articles.\\nFor some keywords, the disparity was even more pronounced. Someone searching for “Republican platform,” for example, would see the official text of the platform followed by seven left-leaning results that were critical of the platform.\\nThe company’s research turned up no right-leaning sites in the top results for keywords like “minimum wage,” “abortion,” “NAFTA,” “Iraq war,” “campaign finance reform,” “global warming,” “marijuana legalization,” and “TPP.”\\n“The proportion of results with a left-leaning bias increased for top ranking results, which typically receive the majority of clicks,” the company found. “For example, we found that search results denoted as demonstrating a left or far left slant received 40% more exposure in the top 3 ranking spots than search results considered to have a right or far right political slant.”\\n“Our analysis of the algorithmic metrics underpinning those rankings suggests that factors within the Google algorithm itself may make it easier for sites with a left-leaning or centrist viewpoint to rank higher in Google search results compared to sites with a politically conservative viewpoint,” the report found. “Though Google would like to portray itself as a fair and balanced arbiter of facts — a role it has recently tried to strengthen with the launch of a fact checking mechanism — searchers should be aware that ranking algorithms don’t currently incorporate an assessment of political bias or even factual accuracy,” the company warned. “No attempt is made to present multiple viewpoints on controversial political issues, and the algorithm in its current form does not return results equally distributed across the entire political spectrum.”\\nGoogle denies charges that the company is manipulating the algorithm to prioritize news from left-leaning sites. “Google does not manipulate results,” Maggie Shiels, a representative from Google’s corporate communications and public affairs, told PJM in an email. “There are more than 200 signals taken into account when someone does a search which include freshness of results.”\\n“These stories are put into clusters to organise the news and to make them easy to search through,” she said, explaining that they have “labels like highly cited, in-depth, etc.” She said her personal search for Trump returned results from BBC, the New York Times, CNBC, CNN, and the Wall Street Journal. “When I click on ‘view all’ I get full coverage — I get CNN, Reuters, Axios, Washington Examiner,” she said. Following those results, she sees her subscriptions, video from Fox and CNN, a timeline, opinion pieces, Twitter, and “all coverage which covers a lot of different publications and is an endless stream of stories from a wide variety of sources.”\\nBloomberg columnist Leonid Bershidsky wrote about the problem of bias earlier this year, reacting to the news of James Damore’s treatment at Google. “Google’s search algorithms are a black box to the public,” he explains. “People inside the company can mess with them without telling us, potentially imposing their internal culture on millions of searchers who have no reason and no desire to share it. This world includes Trump supporters and Antifa activists, creationist pastors and evolutionary biologists, climate change deniers and people who consider them evil. It’s not up to an internet search company to try to level these differences.”\\n“But if that company fosters a work culture in which a certain worldview dominates, can its products be trusted to be neutral?” he asks.\\nIt appears not.\\nMy colleague Roger L. Simon is asking the same questions. He wrote here at PJM earlier this week that social media companies are the most dangerous monopolies — ever. “Facebook, Twitter, and Google are far worse than the original monopolies like International Harvester and Standard Oil and far more dangerous because they monopolize not just our industries but our brains,” he explained. “They control, or at least inordinately influence, how Americans and even much of the world think.”\\nAs more and more people turn to Google and other social media outlets for their news, it may not be hyperbolic to suggest that the biases inherent in human-created algorithms have the potential to affect the fate of democracy. Certainly they can — and likely do — impact the outcomes of elections both here and abroad. With all the talk and hand-wringing about fake news and bad foreign actors using social media outlets to attempt to manipulate election results, far too little attention has been paid to power brokers like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube and their ability — and perhaps even desire — to manipulate public opinion and shape the world into their own Silicon Valley image.\\nFollow me on Twitter @pbolyard'], 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48125164': ['bbc.com', 'Attorney General Barr defends handling of Mueller report amid furore', '', datetime.datetime(2019, 5, 1, 15, 26, 30), 'He disputed that he misled Congress last month when he said he didn\\'t know about the Mueller team\\'s dissatisfaction with his four-page letter summarising the concluded Russia inquiry.

Trump, the chief justice then declared, shall “be, and is hereby, acquitted of the charges.”\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nThe outcome Wednesday followed months of remarkable impeachment proceedings, from Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s House to Mitch McConnell’s Senate, reflecting the nation’s unrelenting partisan divide three years into the Trump presidency.\\nWhat started as Trump’s request for Ukraine to “do us a favor” spun into a far-reaching, 28,000-page report compiled by House investigators accusing an American president of engaging in shadow diplomacy that threatened U.S. foreign relations for personal, political gain as he pressured the ally to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden ahead of the next election.\\nNo president has ever been removed by the Senate.\\nA politically emboldened Trump had eagerly predicted vindication, deploying the verdict as a political anthem in his reelection bid. The president claims he did nothing wrong, decrying the “witch hunt” as an extension of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian 2016 campaign interference by those out to get him from the start of his presidency.\\nTrump’s political campaign tweeted videos, statements and a cartoon dance celebration, while the Republican president himself tweeted that he would speak Thursday from the White House about “our Country’s VICTORY on the Impeachment Hoax.”\\nHowever, the Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said there will always be “a giant asterisk next to the president’s acquittal” because of the Senate’s quick trial and Republicans’ unprecedented rejection of witnesses.\\nA majority of senators expressed unease with Trump’s pressure campaign on Ukraine that resulted in the two articles of impeachment . But two-thirds of them would have had to vote “guilty” to reach the Constitution’s bar of high crimes and misdemeanors to convict and remove Trump from office. The final tallies in the GOP-held Senate fell far short.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nOn the first article of impeachment, abuse of power, the vote was 52-48 favoring acquittal.

After Trump’s July 25 call with Ukraine, the White House temporarily halted U.S. aid to the struggling ally battling hostile Russia at its border.

He’s the undisputed world champion of that. He could easily destroy us if we play it wrong.” Elsewhere, Carlson said of the Trump presidency, “That’s the last four years. We’re all pretending we’ve got a lot to show for it, because admitting what a disaster it’s been is too tough to digest. But come on. There isn’t really an upside to Trump.”\\nIn an earlier filing, we learn that Carlson cared more about Fox’s bottom line than he did about journalistic accuracy after Fox’s White House correspondent dispelled notions about voter fraud and Dominion. “Please get her fired,” Carlson texted to Fox hosts Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity. “Seriously ... What the fuck? I’m actually shocked... It needs to stop immediately, like tonight. It’s measurably hurting the company. The stock price is down. Not a joke.”\\nTo accuse the leading attraction on cable news of being so craven is a big claim. Can we really believe that a prime-time nightly cable host would gin up a unique and false persona just to sucker viewers into watching his show? What responsible observer could make such a claim? Well, two decades ago, Tucker Carlson said exactly that. In his 2003 book, Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News, written long before he joined Fox, Carlson had this to say about Bill O’Reilly, then the king of cable news.\\n“Like everyone in TV, he has a shtick. O’Reilly is Everyman — the faithful but slightly lapsed Catholic son of the working class who knows slick, eastern Establishment BS when he sees it. A guy who tells the truth and demands that others do the same. A man who won’t be pushed around or take maybe for an answer,” Carlson wrote, completely on target.\\nWith a little tweaking, this assessment of O’Reilly could be cut and tapered to dress Carlson. But there’s more. Did Carlson know that he was writing his future prospectus when he continued with these insights about cable’s top host?\\n“O’Reilly’s success is built on the perception that he really is who he claims to be,” Carlson wrote. “If he ever gets caught out of character, it’s over. If someday he punches out a flight attendant on the Concorde for bringing him a glass of warm champagne, the whole franchise will come tumbling down. He’ll make the whatever-happened-to ... ? list quicker than you can say ‘Morton Downey, Jr.’”\\nSoon after the book was published, Carlson went on C-SPAN to reiterate his worship and disdain of O’Reilly. “Bill O’Reilly is really talented, he’s more talented than I am, he’s got a lot more viewers, he’s a better communicator than I am, but I think there is a deep phoniness at the center of his schtick, and again as I say the schtick is built on the perception that he is the character he plays,” Carlson said.\\nWhat Carlson wrote and said in 2003 surprised nobody, especially O’Reilly’s friends, his acquaintances in the journalism profession or even some viewers of his nightly Fox News Channel program. O’Reilly was clearly playing a character of his own invention in a multi-episode TV drama called The O’Reilly Factor. The bluster and outrage, the name calling, O’Reilly’s endless demands that his interview subjects “shut up!“ was all a performance.\\nBill O’Reilly was a phony, and so now we can all see that Tucker Carlson is, too.\\nHaving diagnosed O’Reilly’s shortcomings so long ago, how did Carlson eventually become him? As many have written before, Carlson was one of the most talented Washington-based journalists of his generation. He excelled at the Weekly Standard. At Tina Brown’s Talk magazine, he scored a KO on presidential candidate George W. Bush. He distinguished himself as a New York magazine columnist. He wrote for Esquire.\\nTV came calling at about the same time, and he answered. As I’ve theorized before, Carlson’s slide into the dark side that is Fox News began with his initial failures in the medium. After several years doing CNN’s Crossfire, his show got blown to bits by Jon Stewart’s October 2004 guest appearance. A few months later, the show was canceled and Carlson’s contract was not renewed. Not counting a short run at PBS with a show titled Tucker Carlson: Unfiltered, his next TV stop was MSNBC, which ran from 2005 to 2008. Carlson was genuine to his journalistic values on all of these shows, but none of them took root.\\nRunning out of networks to work for, he finally joined Fox in 2009 and served as a sort of utility player on the network’s shows. It was there and then, I surmise, that Carlson vowed he would not fail at TV again, no matter what. In 2016, Fox returned him to prime-time and gave him his own show. It was then that Carlson began to cultivate the deep phoniness that had made O’Reilly so popular. He co-opted O’Reilly’s everyman schtick, his bluster, his truth-teller guise, and his populism, and he soared in the ratings. When Fox dumped O’Reilly in 2017 — not for breaking character, as Carlson had predicted, but following allegations of sexual harassment — Carlson became the network’s face. And, finally, a towering success.\\nHow much of the Trump agenda did Carlson really buy and how much of it was put on? Absent additional court filings revealing his unguarded thoughts, we may never know. But what we do know now, thanks to the Dominion lawsuit, is that the extremely talented and accomplished Tucker Carlson, hoodwinked by his own ambition, became the very thing the younger and smarter Tucker Carlson scorned in 2003.

But he said the distinction “doesn’t much matter to the dead.”\\n“We cannot let this happen again,” the secretary of state said.\\n“We want to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people. Russia can be a part of that future and play an important role,” Tillerson added in remarks to reporters. “Or Russia can maintain its alliance with this group, which we believe is not going to serve Russia’s interests longer term.”\\nSince the U.S. launched airstrikes against Assad’s forces in retaliation for a chemical attack on civilians last week, Trump administration officials have offered mixed messages about whether Washington believes Assad definitely must surrender power — and when. Tillerson said it was clear the U.S. saw no role for Assad in Syria’s future, given that he had lost legitimacy.\\n“It is clear to all of us that the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end,” he said. “But the question of how that ends and the transition itself could be very important in our view to the durability, the stability inside of a unified Syria.”\\nSEE ALSO: Syria attack blurs focus on ISIS\\n“That’s why we are not presupposing how that occurs,” Tillerson added.\\nHe said the cease-fire talks that Russia and Iran have helped broker in the Kazakh capital, Astana, could generate momentum toward broader talks about a political transition — if the Astana talks succeed in creating a durable cease-fire. The resulting political talks would take place under the auspices of the United Nations process in Geneva.\\n“To date, Astana has not achieved much progress,” Tillerson said.\\nTillerson spoke after a meeting of the “likeminded” countries was hastily arranged on the sidelines of the summit of the Group of Seven industrialized economies in Italy, days after the U.S. for the first time launched airstrikes against Assad’s forces.\\nA key focus since the chemical attack has been on increasing pressure on Russia, Assad’s strongest ally, which has used its own military to keep Assad in power. The U.S. and others have said that Russia bears responsibility for the deaths of civilians at the hands of Assad given Moscow’s role in guaranteeing the 2013 deal in which Assad was supposed to have given up his chemical weapons arsenal.\\nThe U.S. raised the stakes significantly on Monday when a senior U.S. official said Washington has made a preliminary conclusion that Russia knew in advance of Syria’s chemical weapons attack. Yet the U.S. has no proof of Moscow’s involvement, said the official, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on intelligence matters and demanded anonymity.\\nThat accusation will hang over Tillerson’s visit to Moscow, where he plans with meet with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and possibly with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin declined to say whether Putin would meet with Tillerson, in line with its usual practice of not announcing such meetings ahead of time.\\nThe United States has sought to minimize expectations for the trip or the likelihood that the U.S. will leave with any concessions from Russia regarding its support for Assad. Instead, the U.S. is hoping to use the visit — the first by a Trump Cabinet official to Russia — to convey its expectations to Moscow and then allow the Russians a period of time to respond.\\nThough intended to punish Assad for a chemical weapons attack, the U.S. strikes last week served to refocus the world’s attention on the bloody war in Syria, now in its seventh year. Diplomats gathered in Italy as U.S. officials in Washington floated the possibility of new sanctions on the Syrian and Russian military, plus the threat of additional U.S. military action if Assad’s government continues attacking civilians.\\nAt Tuesday’s meeting in the walled Tuscan city of Lucca, the G-7 countries were joined by diplomats from Muslim-majority nations including Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. The inclusion of those countries is important because the U.S. strategy for Syria involves enlisting help from Mideast nations to ensure security and stability in Syria after the Islamic State group is vanquished.'], 'https://www.theepochtimes.com/jan-6-narrative-depends-on-who-tells-the-story_4192898.html': ['theepochtimes.com', 'Jan. 6 Narrative Depends on Who Tells the Story', '', datetime.datetime(2022, 1, 6, 0, 14, 26), 'Jan. 6 Narrative Depends on Who Tells the Story\\nAttendees say its important to understand what really happened that day\\nPolice release tear gas into a crowd during clashes at the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021.

It is a deflection of what happened in Portland and Seattle. That is the definition of an insurrection, and nothing has happened with that,” he said of rioters who attacked federal buildings in those cities and tried to set them on fire.\\nSince Jan. 6, there have been investigations, calls for the public to turn in attendees, home visits from the FBI, arrests, and long prison stays.\\n“It has a chilling effect on the First Amendment, and we can’t have that in this country,” Saccone said. “We have the right to challenge our political leaders. All those First Amendment rights are being challenged by a small minority of left-wing media that are monopolizing the narrative, which is why we have to speak out and correct the narrative.”\\nSaccone says too many people, including elected Republicans, are cowering in fear.\\n“We’re going to tell the truth about Jan. 6 and flip the narrative.

Jake has been in prison since Jan. 13, 2021, charged with assaulting a police officer on Jan. 6.\\nJake Lang (Courtesy Ned Lang)\\nWhen Ned first heard the charges, he was so disappointed that he refused to speak to his son. He didn’t raise him that way and figured, you do the crime, you do the time. But Jake begged his dad to hear his story.\\n“He said, ‘Please, dad, just look at the videos. I saved this man’s life. I was there when Roseanne Boyland died. The police attacked us. We weren’t doing anything wrong. They attacked us for no reason,’” Ned relayed to The Epoch Times.\\nIt is difficult to discern what is happening in the videos which can be seen online at j6truth.org.\\nThe Capitol Police did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\\nIt is clear that Boyland, 34, was on the ground.\\nIn media reports, Capitol Police say she was being trampled, police went into the crowd to save her and were attacked by protesters.\\nProtesters say she was beaten by police with a baton and they were trying to stop police.\\nUltimately, law enforcement dragged her into the Capitol building and she died. Her death was blamed on a drug overdose but her family has publicly questioned the cause.\\nJake was among those who intervened.\\nAfter the rally, he went home to Orange County, New York, where, on the evening of Jan. 13, around 15 federal agents broke in his door and arrested him.\\n“My son has not had a haircut, no shave, in a year,” Ned said. He is Jewish and has not been allowed to go to synagogue.\\nNed saw his son during a September court bail hearing. He described his son’s condition as thin with a scraggy beard that touches his chest, and hair down below his collar. Jake has not been offered bail yet. He has been offered a deal that includes 10 years in prison.\\n“We’re not doing that,” Ned said. “You have all these folks (in Portland, Seattle and the summer riots in Washington D.C.) that were actually attacking cops, trying to burn down federal buildings, and all the horrible things that they were doing. And my son and the rest of the J6 patriots are being harshly persecuted by the same folks that are letting all these other folks just walk after doing the same type of crimes, or worse.”\\n“My son was in 202 days of solitary confinement,” Ned said. “The water in solitary was so dirty—so rusty—that he had to strain the water with a sock in order to be able to drink it or use it at all. It was pure brown and full of dust. He was in total isolation. Just before the rally this summer, the whole patriot unit was locked in the cells for 24/7 for two weeks.”\\nPrisoners at the Correctional Treatment Facility in Washington D.C. are able to communicate with family through electronic tablets, although Jake has not had communication privileges for a few weeks recently, Ned said.\\nHe is proud of Jake for standing up and enduring this pain, with the knowledge that, one day, they will be able to tell the true story what happened on Jan. 6.\\n“I don’t care what side of politics you are on. It is not OK for any government to simply pick you up off the street with whatever charges they want to put against you, and purposely not give you bail,” Ned said. “Right now, there’s bail reform going on throughout the whole United States and these people are being politically persecuted because they’re Trump supporters and that’s not OK. Today, it’s our sons and daughters. Tomorrow when you have a different government with a different political philosophy, it could be your sons and daughters.”\\n“As Putin said so famously, ‘For the first time ever, America has political prisoners.’ America no longer has a high ground to justify punishing another country because of political persecution of their citizens, as America now is doing the same thing,” he said.\\nNo Insurrection\\nAfter the 2020 election, Guy and Nicole Reffitt of Collin County, Texas mulled over what to do to make their voices heard.\\n“Not just in regard to ‘Stop the Steal’ but stop stealing our democracy,” Nicole told The Epoch Times. “We made the decision to go to D.C., because we felt like it was a numbers game—that we had to show up in numbers. It is our duty as Americans, when we see an issue that is plaguing our democracy, to show up. To be idle will kill our country. And we just felt that it was time. If it wasn’t us, who is it going to be?”\\nGuy and Nicole Reffitt (Courtesy Nicole Reffitt)\\nBut Nicole had to work, so Guy, her husband of 21 years, drove from Texas to the Jan. 6 rally without her.\\nAs usual, Guy 49, brought his guns, which he typically carries everywhere. Nicole says he is well versed in the rules. While in Washington, his guns were left secured in his vehicle at the hotel parking lot with the ammunition and guns stored separately.\\nHe attended the rally and was on to the Capitol steps but never went inside, Nicole said. He returned home without incident.\\nBut a family member started political conversations with Guy and secretly recorded him, and then shared the recordings with the FBI, Nicole said.\\nCourt papers say he told his kids that if they turned him in to the FBI, they would be traitors and, “You know what happens to traitors, they get shot.”\\nThis got him charged with obstruction of justice—hindering communication through physical force or threat of physical force, court papers show. He was also charged with transporting firearms with intent to unlawfully use the firearms.\\n“Between the hours of 5 and 6 a.m. on the morning of Jan. 16, the FBI raided our home with flashbangs and a counterterrorism unit,” Nicole said. “They removed me and my teenage daughter and two of her friends and put us behind the battering ram truck. They then took Guy and other than one brief moment at a court hearing when he was still in Dallas, that was the last time I saw my husband. It has been 350 days since I’ve seen him. He’s been denied bail every time for being a danger to the community. Guy has no prior criminal charges against him ever.”\\nGuy works in the Texas energy sector and Nicole is in retail. He was the main breadwinner. Without his paycheck, they couldn’t keep his truck. At the end of December, the family had just $134 and Nicole didn’t know how she was going to make the January rent. She and her daughter, 24, have been working as many hours as possible to make ends meet.\\nSince Christmas Day, Guy and others being held in connection with Jan. 6 have been locked in their cells for 22 hours a day, Nicole said. He went for 11 months without a haircut or shave, from January to December, but one day last month they took him out of his cell and cut his hair.\\n“He’s being punished for something that he hasn’t even been convicted of yet,” Nicole said. “And it goes against everything I feel inside of me not to scream at the top of my lungs at everybody about what is happening because it doesn’t even matter at this point what political aisle you’re on; what’s happening is just complete injustice. And if they’re going to punish us for using our First Amendment rights, if they’re going to punish us because we’re conservatives, they will do that to any other person. If you’re not with their status quo, you are going to be punished, and that is the point that they’re making with our patriots that are being detained now.”\\n“There’s no insurrection. No one has been charged with insurrection, so that is just a falsity,” Nicole said. “That is just a word they keep pushing into people’s faces.\\n“The assault on our democracy has been going on for years. They’ve chipped away at our freedoms. The American people can only take so much and if you just keep complying, you keep allowing them to bend our Bill of Rights, they’re going to have complete control over our country,” she said.\\n“The fortitude of our election integrity should be foremost in any free country. And to not even pause to say, ‘Let’s take a look at this,’ just proves that the people in power, at this point, do not care if they lie to us, or what they do. They’re going to keep pushing the narrative that they want.

Conservative media has come to his defense, some have almost deified him, while he has been vilified by left-wing legacy media with coverage that has been beyond disingenuous.\\nThat being said, right-wing media has omitted key details in its coverage of Rittenhouse, who is on trial for shooting three people, killing two of them, during riots last summer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, after the police shooting of Jacob Blake.\\nWhile right-wing media has rightfully focused on Rittenhouse appearing to have fired shots in self-defense – as the videos show him doing so against agitators including one who tried coming for his gun – other facts also show Rittenhouse was not an absolute innocent in his actions on that fateful August night.\\nAlthough Rittenhouse will likely be acquitted of the homicide-related charges, he should have never been in Kenosha in the first place. So much for conservatives preaching the principle of individual responsibility.\\nFor one, Rittenhouse was 17 years old and carried a firearm – a violation of Wisconsin law, which prohibits minors from having a firearm except for hunting purposes. One of six charges Rittenhouse faces is possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18. Those found guilty of the misdemeanor charge face up to nine months behind bars.\\nSecond, although the seventh and final charge – refusing to follow the 8 p.m. curfew implemented by Kenosha County in response to the protests and riots following Blake’s shooting – was thrown out by the judge in the case, Rittenhouse violated the curfew even if not in the legal sense. The videos obviously show he was out on the streets in violation of the curfew.\\nThird, while Rittenhouse could be acquitted of the charges of killing those two people due to him doing so in self-defense, he could still be convicted of first-degree reckless endangerment with the use of a dangerous weapon. Daily Caller video journalist Richard McGinnis testified that he was in the line of fire when Rittenhouse shot the first victim, Joseph Rosenbaum.\\nEven if Rittenhouse is acquitted on the homicide-related charges, it would not necessarily mean he will be acquitted of the first-degree reckless endangerment charge, which carries a maximum sentence of 17.5 years in prison.\\n“It’s a complicated question,” Wisconsin-based criminal law attorney Anthony Jurek told Mediaite.\\n“Self-defense, as it’s written, is an affirmative defense to any crime,” he said. “And so, hypothetically, it could be used, but additionally, as it’s written, I think that what the [Wisconsin] legislature had anticipated was that it could be applied in a circumstance such as when someone is attacking you.”\\nIn other words, said Jurek, “it’s an open question that the parties are arguing in the Rittenhouse case” and therefore, he added, “I don’t think we can safely assume” that if Rittenhouse is acquitted of first-degree reckless endangerment.\\nJurek noted that, following arguments, the jury will be given instructions, which the prosecution and defense will argue whether to have self-defense be a factor in the deliberation of the first-degree reckless endangerment charge.\\nHowever, Milwaukee-based criminal defense attorney Matthew Meyer told Mediaite that using the excuse of self-defense cannot be used against the charge of first-degree (or second-degree) reckless endangerment. He said that self-defense “requires kind of a direct action” of intentionally targeting someone whereas “recklessly endangering safety … is focused on reckless conduct.”\\n“It’s more of a negligent-type offense where I’m doing something that’s not directed at another but it subjects someone else to a danger,” he said.\\nWisconsin-based criminal defense lawyer Sarah Schmeiser told Mediaite, “Because Kyle Rittenhouse is charged with two counts of first degree recklessly endangering safety as well as various degrees of homicide, yes, he can be convicted of first degree recklessly endangering safety on those counts and acquitted of the separate homicide counts.”\\nThe Right, including its media ecosystem, likes to preach the need to protect law-abiding citizens and go after those who break the law.

Mueller noted that Congress has the power to address whether Trump violated the law.\\n“The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the President’s corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law,” the report stated.\\nMueller also unearthed “numerous links” between the Russian government and Trump’s campaign and said the president’s team “expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts,” referring to hacked Democratic emails.\\nBut Mueller, a former FBI director, concluded there was not enough evidence to establish that Trump’s campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Moscow.\\n(Graphic: Redactions in the Mueller report - tmsnrt.rs/2DnjTvk)\\nTrump appeared to be in a celebratory mood, saying at a White House event with wounded U.S. troops he was “having a good day” following the report’s release, adding, “It’s called no collusion, no obstruction.” Trump, whose legal team called the report “a total victory,” has long described Mueller’s inquiry as a “witch hunt.”\\nTrump headed to his resort in Florida for the weekend, and on landing on Thursday night told a crowd of well wishers at the airport: “Game over folks, now it’s back to work.”\\nThe report, with some portions blacked out to protect sensitive information, provided fresh details of how Trump tried to force Mueller’s ouster, directed members of his administration to publicly vouch for his innocence and dangled a pardon to a former aide to try to prevent him from cooperating with the special counsel.\\n“The President’s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests,” the report stated.\\nThe report said that when former Attorney General Jeff Sessions told Trump in May 2017 that the Justice Department was appointing a special counsel to look into allegations that his campaign colluded with Russia, Trump slumped back in his chair and said, “Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I’m fucked.”\\nAttorney General William Barr told a news conference Mueller had detailed “10 episodes involving the president and discusses potential legal theories for connecting these actions to elements of an obstruction offense.” Barr concluded last month after receiving a confidential copy of Mueller’s report that Trump had not actually committed a crime.\\nTrump was wary of FBI scrutiny of his campaign and him personally, the report said. “The evidence does indicate that a thorough FBI investigation would uncover facts about the campaign and the president personally that the president could have understood to be crimes or that would give rise to personal and political concerns,” the report stated.\\nAny impeachment effort would start in the Democratic-led House of Representatives, but Trump’s removal would require the support of the Republican-led Senate - an unlikely outcome. Many Democrats steered clear of impeachment talk on Thursday, although a prominent liberal congresswoman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, embraced the idea.\\n“Many know I take no pleasure in discussions of impeachment. I didn’t campaign on it, & rarely discuss it unprompted,” she said on Twitter. “But the report squarely puts this on our doorstep.”\\nThe House, when it voted to impeach President Bill Clinton in 1998, included obstruction of justice as one of the charges. The Senate ultimately decided not to remove Clinton from office.\\nThe Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jerrold Nadler, said he would issue subpoenas to obtain the unredacted Mueller report and asked Mueller to testify before the panel by May 23.\\nNadler told reporters in New York Mueller probably wrote the report with the intent of providing Congress a road map for future action, but the congressman said it was too early to talk about impeachment.\\nSlideshow ( 20 images )\\n“Mueller’s report paints a damning portrait of lies that appear to have materially impaired the investigation, a body of evidence of improper contacts with a foreign adversary, and serious allegations about how President Trump sought to obstruct a legitimate, and deeply important, counterintelligence investigation,” the Democratic chairs of six House committees said in a statement.\\nELECTION MEDDLING\\nThe inquiry laid bare what the special counsel and U.S. intelligence agencies have described as a Russian campaign of hacking and propaganda to sow discord in the United States, denigrate 2016 Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and boost Trump, the Kremlin’s preferred candidate. Russia has denied election interference.\\nIn analyzing whether Trump obstructed justice, Mueller looked at a series of actions by Trump, including his attempts to remove Mueller and limit the scope of his probe and efforts to prevent the public from knowing about a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York between senior campaign officials and Russians.\\nIn June 2017, Trump directed White House counsel Don McGahn to tell the Justice Department’s No. 2 official, Rod Rosenstein, that Mueller had conflicts of interest and must be removed, the report said. McGahn did not carry out the order. McGahn was home on a Saturday that month when Trump called him at least twice.\\nSlideshow ( 20 images )\\n“You gotta do this. You gotta call Rod,” McGahn recalled the president as saying, according to the report.\\nHouse Judiciary Democrat Jamie Raskin pointed to Trump’s effort to get McGahn to fire Mueller and then lie about being told to do so as an area of interest for lawmakers, and said McGahn and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions could be valuable witnesses as the committee moves forward.\\n“There are these dramatic episodes of presidential attempts to interfere with the Mueller investigation, and I think people would like to hear from a number of officials involved.

It could use more wall. But it\\'s up to Congress, not the president, to appropriate money for the wall. It should be up to Congress, not the courts, to make the obvious statement that presidential emergency powers are not intended for cases where the president wants something Congress won’t give him.\\nTrump is trampling on the principles of the Constitution with his declaration, even if he may have the legal right because Congress delegated it by statute. Every conservative should have supported the resolution of disapproval that just passed the House and Senate. Many did, but too many did not. Every member of Congress should take this emergency as a signal that it\\'s time for Congress to take back responsibilities it has so causally shed over the years.\\nForty-one Republicans voted with Trump and thus against the proper separation of powers. But we single out Sasse, Cruz, and Tillis because they know better.\\n“It is my responsibility to be a steward of the Article I branch,” Tillis said on Feb. 25, “to preserve the separation of powers and to curb the kind of executive overreach that Congress has allowed to fester for the better part of the past century.\"\\nFollowing those comments, North Carolina Republican operatives began agitating for a primary challenge to Tillis, citing his repeated stands against Trump. So, Tillis on Thursday stopped standing.\\nSasse has been very demonstrative in his resistance to Trump since 2016 — so much so that some vociferously anti-Trump conservatives had hoped he would challenge Trump in 2016 or in the 2020 primary. Most of Sasse’s critiques of Trump have been true, important, and eloquent. But unlike other conservatives who dislike Trump’s comportment and rhetoric and who disagree with him on many policies, a U.S. senator has a vote with which to check the president. And on Thursday, Sasse, also up for re-election in 2020 in a very Trump-friendly state, made it clear he would limit himself to symbolic and rhetorical resistance to Trump’s excesses and defense of the Constitution. (He’ll do so eloquently, we’re sure.)\\nAnd then, there’s Cruz. He came to town as a tireless and fearless anti-establishment fighter and constitutional conservative. He shut down the government in 2013 to show his dedication to opposing Obamacare and to expose the rest of his party’s hypocrisy on the issue.\\nBut the Trump era has shown us a different Cruz: a man who is extraordinary in his manner but less so in his motivations. Cruz understood that Trump saw this vote as a loyalty test, and he wasn’t about to get himself on the wrong side of power.\\nThe 41 GOP votes against the resolution do not merely undermine the constitutional order, they also harm conservatism. The Left loves to declare that conservative talk of principles is a con and a cover story for self-serving ends. Votes like this lend credence to the charge.\\nWe applaud the dozen Republicans who voted for the resolution. We hope Congress’ next step is to pass a bipartisan bill curbing presidential emergency powers.

They might have to.', 'Paul Waldman', datetime.datetime(2019, 12, 24, 14, 30, 22), \"Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\\nWhile we wait for Mitch McConnell and the White House to figure out whether they can get away with beginning and ending President Trump’s impeachment trial in an afternoon, a provocative new question has been raised: Once impeachment is over, presumably with an acquittal in the Senate, could House Democrats impeach Trump for a second time?\\nDon’t dismiss it as an absurd idea just yet. Not only might it happen, but it also might be absolutely necessary. At the very least, considering the possibility will help us understand just how deep our governing crisis could get if Trump wins a second term in office.\\nThis question has come up because of a court case involving former White House counsel Don McGahn, who defied a subpoena from the House Judiciary Committee to give testimony regarding the shocking findings of Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation into the Russia scandal.\\nAdvertisement\\nWhile Democrats had many questions they wanted McGahn to answer, there was particular interest in one episode that seemed a clear case of obstruction of justice. According to Mueller’s report, in 2017 Trump ordered McGahn to fire Mueller, and McGahn refused and threatened to resign. Then later, Trump ordered McGahn to lie publicly about a newspaper article that accurately recounted the fact that Trump had told him to fire Mueller. Finally, Trump tried to get McGahn to create a false paper trail claiming that his order to fire Mueller had never occurred.\\nFollow Paul Waldman 's opinions Follow\\nThat series of events could (and probably should) have been the basis for another article of impeachment, but Democrats chose instead to focus the articles on Ukraine. So in the current court case, the Justice Department has argued that now that impeachment articles have been approved, there’s no longer any need for the courts to rush in to decide whether McGahn has to testify to the Judiciary Committee.\\nBut in a filing to the court of appeals on Monday, lawyers for the committee said this:\\nAdvertisement\\nIf McGahn’s testimony produces new evidence supporting the conclusion that President Trump committed impeachable offenses that are not covered by the Articles approved by the House, the Committee will proceed accordingly — including, if necessary, by considering whether to recommend new articles of impeachment.\\nYou might assume that this is just a clever legal argument, and maybe that’s what it was intended to be. But it’s worth taking the idea seriously, not just of new articles being added to the current impeachment but of an entirely new one at some future date.\\nThe first thing to understand is that the mere fact that no president has ever been impeached more than once doesn’t mean that it can’t happen if the president’s behavior warrants it. There’s no “one and done” clause in the Constitution stating that Congress has only one opportunity to impeach, and if the president is acquitted then he has a free pass for the rest of his time in office.\\nAnd if there were ever a circumstance where a president at least hypothetically might warrant a second impeachment, it’s this one: a president with utter disregard for all norms of ethical behavior who nonetheless has enough slavish support from members of his party in the Senate to make conviction virtually impossible.\\nAdvertisement\\nTo clarify, I’m not talking about Trump being impeached again for the misdeeds for which he is currently being called to account. I’m talking about an impeachment for new misdeeds that we have yet to discover, or that he has not yet committed but will in the future.\\nWhen you consider that future, you realize that another impeachment is a real possibility. Up until now Trump has been acting as though rules and even laws don’t apply to him. He has prevented aides from complying with lawful subpoenas. He had his unhinged personal lawyer take over American foreign policy toward Ukraine, and pressured a foreign government to aid his reelection campaign. He has made clear that he has every intention of seeking and accepting help from other foreign governments for that campaign, beginning with, but not limited to, Russia. He says things such as: “I have an Article II, where I have to the right to do whatever I want as president.”\\nThe House impeached Trump, but it was a victory for alternative facts, Russian disinformation and Fox News, says columnist Dana Milbank. (Video: The Washington Post, Photo: Susan Walsh / AP/The Washington Post)\\nTrump will in all likelihood be acquitted by the Senate, which he will take as a vindication of his prior behavior and proof that he is able to escape any genuine accountability while in the Oval Office, just as he has for his entire life.\\nAdvertisement\\nNow imagine that he wins reelection in November. Does anyone seriously believe that in a second term, Trump wouldn’t commit more impeachable offenses?\\nTry to imagine what a second-term Trump will be like. Will he suddenly begin acting with high ethical standards and a deep respect for the law? Or will he feel even more deeply that he can do whatever he wants and no one can stop him?\\nAt the moment he is at least constrained by the possibility that if he gives his criminal instincts free rein he could suffer for it at the polls — and that has proved to be little constraint at all. Just imagine what he would do when he no longer had to worry about reelection. Is there any bit of self-dealing or abuse of power that presented itself to which Trump would say, “I shouldn’t do that — it would be wrong”?\\nAdvertisement\\nWhere will that leave Congress? He has already hamstrung its ability to conduct oversight through blanket refusals to cooperate (and gotten support for that stonewalling from the same Republicans who conducted eight separate investigations of Benghazi, full of outraged fulmination about the executive branch’s obligation to submit to congressional investigations). When some appalling new scandal is revealed, full of naked corruption and presidential misdeeds, what options will Democrats have? Impeaching him again, even if they can’t win a conviction in the Senate, might be their only choice, and the bare minimum required to fulfill their obligations to the Constitution and the rule of law.\\nSo a second impeachment is not just possible; it also might be all but inevitable given the moral bankruptcy of this president and the gang of sycophants he surrounds himself with. If you think we’re in a crisis of governance now, just wait until Trump wins reelection.\\nRead more:\\nGiftOutline Gift Article\"], 'https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sudden-turn-events-could-derail-trump-indictment': ['foxcom', \"The sudden turn of events that could derail Trump's indictment\", 'Gregg Jarrett, Gregg Jarrett Is A Fox News Legal Analyst, Commentator, Formerly Worked As A Defense Attorney, Adjunct Law Professor.

His modus operandi was to target any man the Soviet dictator chose and then find or fabricate a crime against him.\\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has taken a page out of Stalin’s playbook and targeted Donald Trump. Driven by personal and political animus, the DA presumed the former president must be guilty of something. It was just a matter of devoting enough time and resources to hunt down the crime. Failing to find one, Bragg copied Beria’s paradigm and simply dreamed one up.\\nAs I explained in my last column, the DA invented his case against Trump by taking an alleged misdemeanor business records violation and supercharging it into a felony by citing an imagined second crime arising out of a supposed campaign finance violation. The novelty of such a charge is exceeded only by its absurdity.\\nThe indictment appears to hinge on the DA’s argument that a 2016 payment made to porn star Stormy Daniels was intended to help Trump’s presidential bid and should have been accounted for as a campaign contribution, not legal fees, when he reimbursed his then-lawyer, Michael Cohen, who paid Daniels to keep her mouth shut about a purported 2006 affair that Trump vigorously denies. Confused yet? You should be.\\nSOME DEMOCRATS FEAR ARRESTING TRUMP COULD BACKFIRE, QUESTION STRENGTH OF CHARGES\\nThe flaw in Bragg’s tortured logic is two-fold. First, non-disclosure agreements in exchange for money are perfectly legal. Second, Cohen long ago stated that the payment had nothing to do with the campaign but was made to protect Melania Trump from an embarrassing, albeit false, accusation. As such, it is not an illegal campaign donation under the law. Hence there is no crime.\\nIt appears that Bragg’s star witness is none other than Cohen who has performed an astonishing pirouette by recanting his earlier statements. He now claims that the money was intended to help Trump’s campaign fend off a damaging story. Reliance on such a disreputable character as Cohen is a clear sign of the DA’s desperation. Cohen\\'s hatred of Trump is well known. He has carved out a career of trashing his former boss.\\nCohen has always had a warped relationship with the truth. He peddled so many lies that there is no way to know whether the disgraced and disbarred lawyer even understands the concept of honesty. Among the smorgasbord of crimes that sent him to prison was lying to Congress.\\nIn a sudden turn of events, Cohen’s former attorney Robert Costello — no longer bound by the attorney-client privilege that was waived by his ex-client — testified before the grand jury on Monday. According to Costello, in April 2018, Cohen repeatedly stated that the Daniels payment was intended to protect the candidate’s wife, not the campaign. Moreover, Cohen insisted that he acted all on his own and not at the behest of Trump. While testifying for over two hours, Costello said he realized that Bragg had been hiding from the grand jury nearly all of the files he had previously turned over to the DA that corroborated Cohen’s original story.\\nConcealing exculpatory evidence from a grand jury is reprehensible conduct. But the overarching question is this: Was Cohen lying at the outset of the investigation or is he lying now? I doubt even he knows. Inveterate liars tend to lose track of their lies.\\nBragg’s determination to snooker a grand jury into indicting Trump is an egregious abuse of government authority. It constitutes the weaponization of the law for political gain. But it is also — and importantly — selective prosecution of the worst kind.\\nConsider the case of Hillary Clinton, who secretly funded the anti-Trump dossier in 2016 by deploying campaign lawyers to pay ex-British spy Christopher Steele more than $1 million dollars to compose his phony document. Candidate Clinton listed it as a \"legal expense,\" even though its sole purpose was to advance her campaign against Trump, her opponent. The Federal Election Commission fined Clinton for brazenly violating campaign finance laws.\\nBut New York prosecutors never even thought about bringing criminal charges because it involved, well… Hillary. She has consistently been the beneficiary of a dual system of justice that grants her a permanent \"get out of jail free\" card for whatever crooked scheme she concocts. She was never prosecuted for obvious crimes under the Espionage Act by storing classified records in her home on a personal server. She also destroyed more than 30-thousand documents under congressional subpoena, but no obstruction of justice indictment was ever rendered.\\nJuxtapose the treatment of Donald Trump. The Manhattan district attorney’s office has devoted unlimited resources over many years scouring every aspect of the former president’s personal life and business affairs in a purely partisan quest to find a crime — any crime. They did it because they could, with no compunction over the code of ethics that binds lawyers. Despite the objections of senior experienced prosecutors, the district attorney conjured up a convoluted legal theory to slay his political hobgoblin. It has all the earmarks of a Stalin-like fabrication.\\nMuch of the current witch hunt was driven and directed by former assistant DA Mark Pomerantz, an outsider who was hired for the sole purpose of \"getting Trump.\" When Bragg initially balked at bringing charges, Pomerantz quit in a fit of pique but not before blasting his former boss in a resignation screed conveniently made public.\\nHe then ratcheted up the pressure on Bragg by penning a disgraceful tell-all book. In it, Pomerantz arrogantly laid bare his contempt of Trump because \"he posed a real danger to the country and to the ideals that mattered to me.\" That confessional exposed the underlying rationale for charging Trump. The district attorney soon caved and fully embraced the loony legal theory promoted by Pomerantz.\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\nDisagreeing with someone’s political views or harboring personal animosity is not a basis for criminal prosecution. Indeed, it is a serious breach of legal ethics. It is the duty of a prosecutor to see that justice is done, not to target an individual and contort the law to bring a feckless case against him. Pomerantz should face disbarment for his unconscionable conduct.\\nThe district attorney’s prejudicial pursuit of Trump undermines the vital concept that the administration of justice will be fair and equitable. He has forsaken the presumption of innocence embodied in the 5th, 6th, and 14th Amendments to our Constitution. When it comes to Trump, the DA only operates on the presumption of guilt.\\nAlvin Bragg has chosen to criminalize politics with the zeal of the notorious Lavrentiy Beria.

Their aim was to stop lawmakers finalizing President-elect Joe Biden’s victory ahead of his January 20 inauguration. But the bedlam, which saw rioters smash windows, lay siege to lawmakers and reach the House and Senate chambers, had the opposite effect, hastening the moment of final repudiation for the President and his baseless claims of a stolen election.\\nA number of Senate Republicans who had been minded to drag out the President’s stunt flipped in revulsion at the storming of their citadel of democracy in an ugly culmination of a lawless presidency.

His deputy, Matt Pottinger had already gone Wednesday afternoon, sources told CNN.

However the tumult is resolved, there is the alarming prospect of an uncontrollable President running rampant and a splintered chain of command at the White House that will have grave national security implications and could create a vacuum conducive to further unrest.\\nIt is not clear how much momentum efforts to expel the President will gather with Trump so close to leaving office.

The day’s peril came not from outside but from within, as the Trump mob pulled off an incursion previously only managed by British armies 200 years ago.\\nThere has been a recent debate among journalists on how to refer to Trump’s bid to steal a free and fair election he lost, his refusal to honor a peaceful transfer of power, and his incitement of angry supporters to disrupt the constitutional process.\\n“This is as close to a coup attempt as this country has ever seen,” former Washington Police Chief Charles Ramsey told CNN.\\nTimothy Naftali, a CNN presidential historian from New York University, said that Trump had broken a golden thread of democracy that has sustained American freedom.\\n“Today was the first time in our history that a President has opposed a peaceful transfer of power,” Naftali said.\\nA ‘shameful’ episode\\nThe question now is whether Wednesday’s outrage will be a one-off eruption, that once quelled, will become an awful memory of a presidency that tore the country apart.\\nBut the bitter feelings unleashed by Trump are not confined to the tens of thousands of supporters who flocked to Washington, DC. The President and his media shills have seeded a pernicious mistrust of democracy across vast swathes of the country. The majority of Trump voters are not violent. But millions of them believe his poison about the election being stolen — and think their country is being taken away from them.

Mitt Romney said that the best way to show respect for voters who are upset at the election result is not to perpetuate Trump’s lies but to tell them the truth.\\n“Those who choose to continue to support his dangerous gambit by objecting to the results of a legitimate, democratic election will forever be seen as being complicit in an unprecedented attack against our democracy.”\\nSeveral Republican senators were angered by Wednesday’s events – despite sending a signal of impunity for Trump’s previous abuses of power by voting to acquit him in his impeachment trial and forging a marriage of convenience with Trump to pursue shared goals like confirming conservative judges.\\n“Trump and I have, we’ve had a hell of a journey. I hate it to end this way. Oh my God, I hate it,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said. “All I can say is count me out. Enough is enough,” Graham said.\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell condemned the violence and reinforced his opposition to efforts to block Biden’s victory.\\n“We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats,” McConnell said. “We will certify the winner of the 2020 presidential election.”\\nEleventh hour resignations and acknowledgments of Biden’s victory, however, are hardly profiles in courage following the indulgence granted by Republicans to Trump’s anti-democratic conduct and weeks of appeasing his denial of Biden’s victory.\\nTrump silent amid the mayhem\\nWhile members of Congress took cover beneath their seats, and his supporters roamed though leadership offices, Trump did nothing — but watch the mayhem that he had triggered unfold on TV.\\nOne source told CNN’s Kaitlin Collins that Trump was more preoccupied with what he sees as Pence’s political apostasy after the vice president announced he would not seek to disrupt the certification of Biden’s victory — a step he had no power to take in any case. Eventually, Trump issued a video telling protesters to go home but exacerbated the situation by making more disgraceful and false allegations about a stolen election.\\nThe President’s silence when real violence was raging contrasted with his incessant and false pre-election claims that leftist mobs were running rampant through US cities and his calls for the restoration of “Law and Order.”\\nAnd the apparently meager US Capitol Police forces that were overwhelmed in Congress contrasted sharply with the heavily armed phalanxes of security forces Trump poured onto streets filled by Black Lives Matters protests over the summer. On that notorious occasion, the Justice Department sent federal troops into Lafayette Square with tear gas to clear protesters ahead of an absurd presidential photo-op.\\nIt was left to Biden, who will take office in a country brought to its knees by Trump’s divisiveness and a pandemic that is now claiming more than 3,000 American lives per day, to offer the steady hand of leadership.\\n“This is not dissent. It is disorder. It is chaos.

Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\\nThe only thing damning about Wednesday’s testimony was the testimony itself.\\nAfter the House Intelligence Committee hearing, pundits and politicians on the left tried to claim Gordon Sondland’s testimony as a win — even as a “bombshell.” But in reality, he dropped bombs while also defusing them. He was contradictory and confused, but House Democrats didn’t care. This was just the latest chapter in a book they wrote months ago.\\nAt the prompting of Democrats, the ambassador gave hours of testimony on some scheme he imagined was happening. But that testimony was mostly made up of secondhand or speculative claims. He testified that he “presumed” and “came to believe” that the administration was engaged in quid pro quo for certain investigations — providing no proof or new evidence. He also said his theories about why aid was withheld were a “guess.”\\nOUR VIEW: Credible Sondland is no Never Trumper. House hearings now need Bolton, Pompeo, Mulvaney.\\nYet he did give some conclusive evidence and firsthand knowledge — it all confirmed the opposite of the impeachment narrative. He stated that in his direct contact with President Donald Trump, the president explicitly and repeatedly stated “no quid pro quo.” And in reference to a supposed push for investigations into 2016 or Burisma, Ambassador Sondland also said he “never heard it from the president.”\\nThe testimony was far from conclusive. Congress has called many “star” witnesses, yet they are no closer to proving an impeachable act than they were two months or two years ago. This entire process has been a politically motivated distraction, and Wednesday was no different. The left is attempting to overturn the results of 2016 based on presumption, speculation, and second- and thirdhand information.\\nAmbassador Sondland’s testimony was not damning. What’s damning is that three-quarters of Americans disapprove of Congress’ performance, yet Democrats refuse to do their jobs by funding the government, passing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal or protecting the border.

Bush in 2000 by a margin of around 500,000 votes and Donald Trump in 2016 by about 3 million.\\nAt issue is the uniquely American system of the Electoral College, which provides that a group of specially chosen representatives (538 at present) for each state choose the president, generally using a winner-takes-all model based on the popular vote.\\nThe system was a compromise for the framers, making concessions to count slave populations in the otherwise less populated South and not placing too much trust in either Congress or the public with choosing the president. But the end result in recent years, as the urban versus rural divide has deepened, is that a handful of battleground states have gained a disproportionate amount of power and prominence.\\nA map released by the Associated Press shows the Electoral College vote count as of 7:15 p.m. EST on Dec. 14, 2020. The map has been rotated and cropped by ABC. AP\\nEven this year, with Joe Biden garnering some 7 million more votes than Trump (and 306 electoral votes), the margins in a number of battlegrounds were extremely close and the result was unclear for days, delaying the nation’s ability to call a clear winner.\\nCritics say that with the focus on battlegrounds while two-thirds of states are overlooked in campaigning, the system is fundamentally flawed, an assertion with which a majority of Americans agree (61%), according to the most recent Gallup poll.\\nBut the alternatives to the system present a new set of challenges.\\nHere\\'s what those might look like:\\nHow could the country enact a popular vote system?\\nThe popular vote isn\\'t part of the constitutional process for choosing a president -- that is instead left up to the state legislatures and the Electoral College.\\n\"There\\'s no such thing right now as the national popular vote. It\\'s just a bunch of 50 state races that get added together,\" explained Barry Burden, political science professor and founding director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\\nWhile a direct popular vote is an attractive idea at first glance, with advocates arguing it would ensure the candidate with the most votes wins, encourage vote turnout and force candidates to campaign outside battleground states, switching to a direct popular vote system would create complications that don\\'t exist now.\\nElection experts questioned the administrative structure that would be the official \"calculator\" for the popular vote (since elections are administered by states) and one speculated the change could even lead to federal oversight of state polling sites.\\nLillian Roberts wears a face mask reading \\'Let my people vote\\' while waiting in line to cast her ballot in the U.S. Senate runoff elections on the first day of early voting in Atlanta, Dec. 14, 2020. Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters\\nVoter qualifications also differ by state, the experts said. For example, some states have restrictions on felon voting rights while others don\\'t and experts said a popular vote could lead states to expand voting to 17-year-olds, for instance.\\n\"If states were left in charge of running their own elections, some states would have incentive to try to run up the vote and expand the electorate. And not saying that\\'s a bad thing, but people need to think about it,\" said Robert Erikson, a political science professor at Columbia University.\\nA direct popular vote would also open the field to a greater extent than it is now to third parties, creating the potential for a candidate to win the White House without more than 50% of the vote and raising questions of whether the government would conduct a national runoff.\\nA constitutional amendment might be the cleanest way to address these questions in advance, but even if parties were able to garner bipartisan support on what that might look like, amending the constitution is an arduous task. There have been nearly 800 attempts to eliminate or reform the Electoral College and not a single effort has succeeded.\\nThe White House is seen as the Electoral College cast their votes around the Nation, in Washington, Dec, 14, 2020. Doug Mills/The New York Times via Redux\\n\"While I\\'m very sympathetic to the national popular vote philosophy, because the individual voter, no matter where they live should be equal to the greatest degree possible, actually turning the national popular vote into reality is a pretty complicated thing,\" said Jay Barth, a longtime politics professor at Hendrix College in Arkansas. \"A constitutional amendment would answer a lot of these questions on the front end rather than having to figure it out on the fly.\"\\nThe problem with \\'winner-takes-all\\'\\nSome argue the system can be reformed without changing the Constitution and that the real problem with the Electoral College stems from 48 states using a winner-take-all method in awarding its states electors.\\nWhile giving states the power to choose how its electors are awarded is enshrined in the Constitution, the winner-take-all method of granting them is not. Under winner-takes-all, a state awards all of its electors to the candidate with the most votes no matter how small the margin of victory -- effectively discounting millions of votes.\\nJohn Koza, chairman of nonprofit National Popular Vote, said it\\'s the winner-take-all system that has enabled five presidents to take office without winning the most votes nationwide and encouraged candidates to focus on closely divided battleground states that don\\'t represent the country at large. As there have been fewer landslides in presidential races yet the electoral vote remains competitive, he said, the current system will continue to generate uncertainty, recounts and litigation, despite the popular vote winner being clear on election night.\\nIn addition to Trump and Bush, Presidents Benjamin Harrison in 1888, Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876 and John Quincy Adams in 1824 also took office having received less popular votes than their competitors.\\n\"Without reform, the system is a ticking time bomb,\" Koza said, noting the potential catastrophe if a candidate who lost the Electoral College but won the popular vote refused to concede. That could have happened in the 2000 election, in which the popular vote was close and the contest hung on one state, Florida. Although concessions aren\\'t required, there\\'s potential to cause a lack of faith in the system without them.\\nVice President Al Gore gives his election concession speech from the Old Executive Office Building in Washington, Dec. 13, 2000.

It draws attention to the small aspects of election laws in those states that end up being really consequential because a few thousand votes in a place like Wisconsin or Georgia could change the outcome of who wins the White House,\" he said.\\nKoza said that apart from post-election chaos, the deleterious effects of winner-takes-all can be felt on the campaign trail. According to the National Popular Vote, two-thirds of states are routinely skipped in presidential election campaigns -- including 12 of the 13 smallest states, which supporters of the current system say it\\'s designed to protect.\\nTwo of the states with the most electoral votes -- New York and California, have not voted for a Republican for president since the 1980s. Texas has not voted for a Democrat since 1976, although there is regularly talk about the state turning purple.\\n\"When people say that they don\\'t vote in the presidential race -- the most interesting race -- because their vote doesn\\'t count, they\\'re absolutely correct depending on where they live, \" said Koza. \"We don\\'t like to put it that way because there\\'s plenty of other offices to vote for, but the reality is, voters\\' votes don\\'t count.

If states possessing at least 270 electoral votes were to sign on, the pact would ensure that the presidential candidate who received the most votes nationwide took office.\\nCurrently, legislatures in 15 states and Washington D.C. -- representing 196 electoral votes -- have enacted the national popular vote bill into law, so if states having 74 electoral votes were to sign on, potentially a minimum of three more states, it would automatically go into effect.\\nCritics say that without the consent of Congress, the interstate pact is unconstitutional, and election experts, considering partisan politics, predict it will be challenged in court if enough states sign on.\\nSplitting the difference?\\nOthers say instead of a winner-take-all system, states could turn to the example of Maine and Nebraska, which award electors by congressional district as well as the overall vote for those state\\'s remaining two electoral votes. But that option could present more serious problems because of gerrymandering, with one expert deeming the system going nationwide a \"Republican\\'s dream.\"\\nErikson said the system would shift politics in \"crazy ways,\" he said, where instead of battleground states, competitive districts would get all the attention.\\nAwarding a state\\'s electors based on a proportion of population to the popular vote is the alternative some experts said is the most viable solution.\\nUnder this method, a state\\'s electors could be split, encouraging candidates to compete for votes within every state to accumulate the highest possible number of electoral votes. However, it\\'s unlikely every state would agree to switch to awarding its electors proportionally off the popular vote because of partisan considerations -- which is how the winner-takes-all system was enacted in the first place.\\nDemocratic Electoral College elector Calvin Smyre casts his vote for Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris in the Georgia State Senate chambers in the Georgia State Capitol building in Atlanta, Dec. 14, 2020.

He explained that every state would have to switch to awarding its electors based on proportion of the vote to population at the same time, otherwise a state would be minimizing its power while other states held onto winner-take-all laws.\\nBurden also reminded there is a small-state bias already built into the Electoral College since every state gets three electors -- it\\'s minimum number of senators and representatives combined -- so even with proportion by population, small states would still carry more electoral weight.\\nWhat are the prospects?\\nAll of the alternatives have one problem in common: it will be difficult if not impossible to implement any of them given the partisan politics across the country.\\nAt the national level, a constitutional amendment would require the approval of two-thirds of the Congress and then three-fourths of states\\' legislatures. States could bypass Congress by having two-thirds of state legislatures call a convention, but efforts using the convention method have never been successful. It\\'s more likely the country will see states explore new ways to grant their electors.\\nKoza, who expects the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact to gain traction in the coming cycles, argues one of the reasons change is possible is \"because neither party has a really convincing case as to why the current system helps them or hurts them.\"\\nMissouri\\'s Electoral College members take photos of themselves and the audience as they meet Monday, Dec. 14, 2020, in the Senate Lounge at the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City, Mo.

And on Friday, he will visit St. Andrew’s Catholic School in Orlando to conduct what aides described as a listening session on school choice.\\nIn his address Tuesday night, Trump sought to repackage his hard-line campaign promises with a moderate sheen, declaring what he termed “a new chapter of American greatness” of economic renewal and military might.\\n[The contradictions of Trump’s presidency]\\nSeeking to steady his presidency after a tumultuous first 40 days, Trump had an air of seriousness and revealed flashes of compassion as he broadly outlined an agenda to rebuild a country he described as ravaged by crime and drugs, deteriorating infrastructure and failing bureaucracies.\\nTrump’s speech touched on his plans to overhaul the nation’s health-care system and tax code, but it was short on specifics and heavy on lofty prose. Struggling to steer a bitterly divided nation with his job-approval ratings at historic lows, Trump effectively pleaded with the American people to give him a chance and to imagine what could be achieved during his presidency.\\n“We are one people, with one destiny,” Trump said quietly near the end. “The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.”\\nThe softer edges than in previous speeches, including Trump’s inaugural address, prompted speculation about whether he was attempting a broader shift in his leadership style. That style has been marked by numerous distractions, including some he has instigated on Twitter.\\nAs of 9 a.m. Wednesday, Trump had tweeted only two words since his speech: “THANK YOU!”\\nDemocrats warned that less had changed than it might appear.\\n“With this president more than any other, his speeches are detached from reality,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday morning on NBC’s “Today” show. “In his campaign, and even his inaugural speech, he talks to the working people of America, but for the last 40 days, his actions have been decidedly on the side of special interests, hurting working America.”\\nSchumer criticized Trump for, among other things, not yet presenting a package to overhaul the nation’s infrastructure, despite heralding that aim in his speech.\\n“He’s not governing like his speeches,” Schumer said. “This speech will be forgotten in a day or two, and where’s the action?”\\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) struck a similar tone Wednesday, calling Trump “a good salesman” who delivered “a bait-and-switch speech.”\\n“He hasn’t had a proposal on jobs, on infrastructure, not even renegotiating NAFTA, which he promised,” Pelosi said during an appearance on MSNBC, referring to the North American trade pact.\\nDemocrats also expressed skepticism about Trump’s comments Tuesday suggesting that he is open to an immigration overhaul that could provide a pathway to legal status. Trump made the remarks during a private White House luncheon with television news anchors but made no mention of it in his speech.\\n“We await the details of what a plan might be that be that could get by a Republican, right-wing House of Representatives that so far has opposed any real meaningful comprehensive immigration policy,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) during an appearance Wednesday on CNN.\\nTrump did extend some olive branches to his opponents. He called on Congress to pass paid family leave, a reference to a long-held Democratic Party priority that brought liberal lawmakers to their feet to applaud. And he pledged to work with Muslim allies to extinguish Islamic State terrorists, going so far as to acknowledge the killings of Muslims as well as Christians in the Middle East.\\nStill, Trump did not back away from his most controversial policies. He used typically bellicose language to describe the fight against the Islamic State, calling it “a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women and children of all faiths and all beliefs.” He made a point to utter the phrase “radical Islamic terrorism,” which Republicans cheered heartily.\\n[President Trump’s joint address to Congress, annotated]\\nThe president forcefully defended his travel ban of refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries — an executive order that was halted in federal court — as necessary to prevent the entry of foreigners who do not share America’s values.\\n“We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America,” Trump said. “We cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.”\\nTrump had planned to unveil a revised order Wednesday, but that appeared to be pushed off until later in the week in the wake of his generally well-received speech.\\nIn the speech, the president trumpeted his plans to budget a major increase in military spending. One of Trump’s fiercest Republican critics, Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), stood enthusiastically when the president said he would end the “defense sequester” caps on Pentagon spending.\\nOn foreign affairs, Trump said he would honor historic alliances — and explicitly stated his support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, on which he had wavered during his campaign — but said he would seek new ones as well, even with former adversaries. The latter seemed an indirect reference to potentially working to combat terrorism with Russia, which U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded meddled in the November election in hopes of helping Trump.\\n“America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align,” Trump said. “We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.”\\nTrump declared that the time had come to rewrite trade deals and alliances in terms that benefit the United States, irrespective of global pressures.\\n[Fact Checker: A speech riddled with inaccuracies]\\n“My job is not to represent the world,” Trump said. “My job is to represent the United States of America.”\\nTrump was adamant that the United States cannot continue to abide by what Republicans and Democrats see as free trade. “It also has to be fair trade,” Trump said. He cited Abraham Lincoln, who, he said, “warned that the ‘abandonment of the protective policy by the American government [will] produce want and ruin among our people.’ ” He said he would not let workers “be taken advantage of anymore.”\\nTrump, as he typically does, basked in his electoral feat and cast his ascent to the presidency in epic terms. “In 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet,” he said, adding that a “rebellion” that started as “a quiet protest” morphed into “a loud chorus” and finally “an earthquake.”\\nHe said he was sent to Washington to deliver on the promises he made on the campaign trail — arguably chief among them, to build a wall along the border with Mexico. Trump argued that everyday Americans cannot succeed “in an environment of lawless chaos” at the borders.\\nTrump challenged both parties in Congress to move quickly to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Obama’s signature health-care law.\\n“Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans,” Trump said. “Action is not a choice; it is a necessity.”\\nTrump also called for a $1 trillion infrastructure plan that he said would be the biggest program of national rebuilding since President Dwight D. Eisenhower built the interstate highway system in the 1950s. Trump said his projects would be financed through a combination of public and private capital, but he offered no further details.\\nTrump was more somber than usual, toning down his bravado, but there were moments where he reveled in his celebrity. He glad-handed Supreme Court justices as he made his way to the rostrum and shared small talk with a reverential congressman, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.). As he left at the end of his speech, he paused to autograph books in the aisle.\\nPaul Kane, Abby Phillip and Sean Sullivan contributed to this report.\\nRead more at PowerPost'], 'https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/02/william-barr-fall-department-of-justice-donald-trump.html': ['slate.com', 'William Barr and the fall of the Department of Justice.', 'Dahlia Lithwick', datetime.datetime(2020, 2, 19, 19, 39, 56), 'After the worst week in the history of an independent Justice Department since Watergate, on Tuesday, Donald Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of 11 grifters, white-collar criminals, and liars. Declaring himself “the chief law enforcement officer of the country” (he isn’t), the president continued to tweet at the federal judge who will sentence his buddy, Roger Stone, on Thursday, even though his own Attorney General William Barr has said that Trump tweeting about ongoing criminal investigations and cases make it “impossible for me to do my job.” On Tuesday night, Barr leaked to the press that he is contemplating quitting the DOJ if Trump continues to insert himself publicly into ongoing matters of federal criminal law enforcement. This would be a shame for Barr, since both he and Trump seek to create a banana republic in the United States—the only difference is that Barr wants it to have the vestigial trappings of a constitutional democracy and the president’s outbursts keep getting in his way.\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nThe crisis at the Justice Department began in earnest last week. Four federal prosecutors quit the Roger Stone case (and one departed the Justice Department altogether) after Barr withdrew their proposed sentencing recommendation following Trump’s tweet demanding a lesser punishment for Stone. Barr, insisting that he had undermined the career prosecutors in the case despite Trump’s tweets and not because of them, did an astonishing ABC interview in which he asked the president to stop interfering with the cases he was already ably undermining himself. “I’m not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody,” he said.\\nBarr has already installed politically supportive U.S. attorneys to review the DOJ’s work in several high-profile cases that involved the president, including the Michael Flynn prosecution and the Russia probe completed by Robert Mueller. Barr also just announced that he would like to conscript local sheriffs in his efforts to retaliate against so-called sanctuary cities. In other words, he is working assiduously to cast doubt on any prosecutions that touch Trump and also to intimidate the president’s alleged enemies. All he is asking in exchange is for the president’s quiet compliance with the program. But Trump continues to tweet about his grudges and imaginary persecutions, now going after a juror in an overt effort to chill juries that do not support him. This is not a good look for Barr, as it undermines his ability to quietly complete the job, and Barr knows it.\\nAdvertisement\\nDonald Trump doesn’t understand that the DOJ isn’t his personal law firm.\\nOver the weekend, more than 2,000 former DOJ employees signed a public letter urging Barr to resign over his handling of the Stone sentencing, and Donald Ayer, who served as deputy attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, called for Barr’s resignation in the Atlantic. “Bill Barr’s America is not a place that anyone, including Trump voters, should want to go,” Ayer wrote. “It is a banana republic where all are subject to the whims of a dictatorial president and his henchmen. To prevent that, we need a public uprising demanding that Bill Barr resign immediately, or failing that, be impeached.” Last week, the president of the American Bar Association, Judy Perry Martinez, issued an abrupt statement in support of prosecutorial independence. On Tuesday, the Federal Judges Association, an independent organization of U.S. judges, held an emergency meeting to address the politicization of the Justice Department. Also on Tuesday, Trump tweeted inchoate threats to sue the Mueller team and further commentary about the Stone judge and a juror in the Stone trial, presumably leading to Barr’s Tuesday night signaling that he is considering quitting, possibly to add his name to the long list of concerned Trump enablers who signal independence by way of lucrative publishing deals and memos to the file.\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nAs has happened in the case of every high-profile departure from the mayhem that is Donald Trump as president, there is an argument to be made that Barr’s departure would not solve the root problem. After all, as Joel Mathis notes in the Week, the fish rots from the head, and if Barr resigns, “Trump will either pick a replacement attorney general who is all too happy to do the president’s bidding and continue the degradation of justice at the federal level—or he will accidentally pick a lawyer with integrity, then bully that person into complying with his wishes. Neither scenario is great for the independence and reputation of the Department of Justice.” The solution, to be sure, is for Trump to be voted out of office in November and for DOJ norms and practices around independence to be formally reinstated after he is gone. But in the meantime, the Justice Department or the American legal apparatus should not continue grinding away doing Trump’s bidding, in the hopes that it can be made to look more democratic or legalistic, when the end product remains the systematic terrorizing of the president’s enemies and the offering of succor to his allies.\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nThe question, then, for the American legal system today is simple: Is it time for more dramatic measures? Why is it that only two city bar associations have called for congressional oversight of the attorney general’s actions? (New York City did so last week, and the Boston Bar followed with a demand that his actions be explained.) On Tuesday evening, Walter Dellinger, acting solicitor general in the Clinton administration, suggested on MSNBC, that 2,000 signatures on a letter may not be sufficient pushback from former federal prosecutors; instead, if they really want to stop this pernicious politicization of the department, they should be prepared to be arrested outside the Justice Department.\\nAdvertisement\\nBy far the most chilling moment in the largely incoherent interview Donald Trump offered Geraldo Rivera last week came when, in direct contradiction of his November statement, he insisted that he had sent Rudy Giuliani as his personal lawyer to Ukraine to dig up dirt on the Bidens, because, as he put it, “Here’s my choice: I deal with the [James] Comeys of the world, or I deal with it another way.” Donald Trump has no faith in his own intelligence services unless they are confirming his predetermined conclusions; he has no faith in his Justice Department, unless it is prosecuting his opponents; he has no faith in his own attorney general, unless he is using the sprawling apparatus of the federal criminal justice system to prosecute his enemies. That is how he understands the Constitution, as a mirror for his self-obsessed worldview. Donald Trump doesn’t understand that the DOJ isn’t his personal law firm. As Ayer meticulously explained, Bill Barr scored his job as attorney general in no small part by insisting that this is precisely what the Justice Department should be, and in the post, Barr has done his best to deliver precisely the Justice Department his boss believes to be his due.\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nThis entire weaponization of DOJ investigations, prosecutions, and sentences to punish perceived enemies and to reward loyal factotums is a threat to the rule of law in America. Every judge and every lawyer in the country understands this intuitively. Despite Barr’s insistence, the ominous fault line isn’t between the president’s tweeted threats at the sentencing judge in the Stone trial and his silence. The real fault line is between what has happened, in the aggregate, on Barr’s cheerful watch—the Department of Justice has become another corner of the government that protects not the rule of law but this president, and not just this specific president, but this specific kind of president, the kind who believes himself immune to legal accountability. As Adam Serwer points out in the Atlantic:\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nBut keeping Trump in office is not the ultimate goal, despite party members’ obsequious public performances toward Trump. Rather, the purpose is to preserve the authoritarian structure Trump and Barr are building, so that it can be inherited by the next Republican president. To be more specific, the Trump administration is not fighting a “deep state”; it is seeking to build one that will outlast him.\\nThe only remaining question is what to do about it, and specifically what lawyers, judges, and law students, all of whom know in their bones what is happening, should do about it. If ever there were a time for the American legal profession to put down its yellow pads and stand up for the rule of law, it’s today, en masse, and without waiting for someone, more senior, somewhere, to lead the way. The catastrophe unfolding at the DOJ transcends Barr and his TV spat with Trump. We are watching what happens when the law is warped to please a man who believes himself to actually be the law, and what happens when his enabler agrees with that project, and disagrees only on appearances.'], 'https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/nov/13/donald-trump-was-right-to-boot-cnns-jim-acosta-out/': ['washingtontimes.com', \"Donald Trump was right to boot CNN's Jim Acosta out of the White House\", 'The Washington Times Https, Joseph Curl', datetime.datetime(2018, 11, 13, 19, 6, 6), 'OPINION:\\nTo hear members of the White House press corps tell it, at stake is the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and perhaps the very future of America as we know it.\\nIn reality, it’s nothing of the kind.\\nCNN’s Jim Acosta was booted out of the White House last week because he’s a petulant crybaby who decided that he would simply bully his way into asking the president (of the United States, mind you) question after question after question after you get the idea.\\nYes, CNN contends Mr. Acosta was simply exercising his First Amendment right to refuse to give up the microphone during a presidential press conference, and even swipe away the hand of a young woman who was just trying to do her job. For that reason, President Trump (and you know it was President Trump) had Mr. Acosta’s press pass revoked. Like the Soup Nazi in “Seinfeld,” he said: “No soup for you! Come back, one year!”\\nOn Tuesday, CNN filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration in federal court demanding the White House return Mr. Acosta’s permanent press pass. The suit names not just the Trump administration as a defendant, but press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, and the Secret Service agent who physically revoked Mr. Acosta’s credentials as well (so petty).\\nTo recap, Mr. Acosta had refused to allow other reporters attending the presidential press conference to ask questions by refusing to hand back the microphone in a grandstanding display (a move former President George W. Bush used to call “peacocking”). And he really didn’t want Mr. Trump to answer, anyway, he was there to make biased statement after biased statement.\\nThis is the 187th time Mr. Acosta has peacocked, so, finally fed up, the White House pulled his “hard” pass. That, CNN contended in its Tuesday filing, is flatly unconstitutional.\\n“The wrongful revocation of these credentials violates CNN and Acosta’s First Amendment rights of freedom of the press, and their Fifth Amendment rights to due process,” CNN said in a press release. “We have asked the court for an immediate restraining order requiring the pass to be returned to Jim, and will seek permanent relief as part of this process.”\\nBut here’s the truth of the matter: CNN has some 50 other hard passes, and the White House yanked only Mr. Acosta’s pass, for one simple reason: He’s rude.\\nIn the White House, reporters are (rightly) expected to behave like grown-ups. Yes, they’re there to do a job — a very important job. But that doesn’t give them the right to be rude, or to flout the rules of civilized society. The First Amendment does not give anyone the right to simply berate the president during a White House press conference, and Mr. Trump finally said, “Enough is enough.”\\nMrs. Sanders on Tuesday perfectly explained the situation after CNN filed its lawsuit.\\n“We have been advised that CNN has filed a complaint challenging the suspension of Jim Acosta’s hard pass. This is just more grandstanding from CNN, and we will vigorously defend against this lawsuit,” she said in a statement.\\n“CNN, who has nearly 50 additional hard pass holders, and Mr. Acosta is no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment. After Mr. Acosta asked the President two questions — each of which the President answered — he physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions. This was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters.\\n“The White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts this way, which is neither appropriate nor professional. The First Amendment is not served when a single reporter, of more than 150 present, attempts to monopolize the floor. If there is no check on this type of behavior it impedes the ability of the President, the White House staff, and members of the media to conduct business,” Mrs. Sanders said.\\nThe White House Correspondents’ Association on Tuesday criticized the removal of Mr. Acosta’s pass.\\n“Revoking access to the White House complex amounted to disproportionate reaction to the events of last Wednesday,” said group president Olivier Knox. “The president of the United States should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him.”\\nBut it’s not that at all. Mr. Acosta’s just a snotty little brat who needs a timeout. Now, he’s having one. And that’s actually a good thing. To CNN, the message is clear: Bring a grown-up to the White House. Until then, sit quietly in the corner and think about what you did wrong.\\n• Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.

Biden served on the management company’s board while his father was vice president, but his attorney says that was an unpaid position, that he did not create the company and has not yet received any money, let alone millions. The attorney says Hunter Biden only acquired a minority stake in the investment management company after his father left office.\\nWe have found no evidence to contradict that, and Trump hasn’t provided any. We also found no evidence that Joe Biden used his position as vice president to enrich his son.\\nTrump has made numerous comments calling for the investigation of Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine and China, which the president suggests involved Joe Biden. We have written about how the president has twisted the facts on the Bidens and Ukraine, and here we will address claims related to China.\\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that Hunter Biden “made millions of dollars” from China “very rapidly” while his father was vice president. Trump and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, have both claimed that Hunter Biden got “$1.5 billion” from China for a private equity fund.\\n“When Biden’s son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund — and the biggest funds in the world can’t get money out of China — and he’s there for one quick meeting, and he flies in on Air Force Two, I think that’s a horrible thing. I think it’s a horrible thing,” Trump said during a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sept. 25.\\nDuring an Oct. 3 press conference, Trump called on China to “start an investigation into the Bidens.” Trump said China probably has enjoyed “a sweetheart deal” with the U.S. on trade, “because they deal like people with Biden, where they give their son a billion and a half dollars.” He called it a “payoff.”\\nChina has since rejected Trump’s call to investigate the Bidens.\\nOn ABC’s “This Week” on Sept. 29, Giuliani rattled off various claims, including saying that Hunter Biden got “$1.5 billion from China while [Vice President Biden was] negotiating with China.”\\nGiuliani, Sept. 29 : And there are three partners, Rosemont Seneca. That’s Hunter Biden and [Christopher Heinz] the stepson of the — of the secretary of state [John Kerry]. The second partner is the Bank of China. And the third partner is a company called Thornton Group. … The $1.5 billion was in a company that was specially established called Bohai Harvest Rosemont Seneca or some crazy name like that. The partners were Joe Biden’s son, John Kerry’s stepson, the Bank of China, one-third partner at least, and the Thornton Group. That was owned by Whitey Bulger’s nephew. Now, that’s all out there. You can go and look at it. If I’m wrong, I’m wrong. It should be investigated.\\nHunter Biden was involved with the cross-border equity consortium in question, but the $1.5 billion was what the fund hoped to raise in 2014 for investments. It is not the value of the management company in which Hunter Biden now holds a minority share. It’s unclear if that $1.5 billion goal was reached in its first year, as the investment fund had forecast, but the company website says it now manages assets worth the equivalent of over $2.1 billion in U.S. dollars.\\nGiuliani’s mention of the three partners in Rosemont Seneca is a good place to start.\\nThe same year that Barack Obama and Joe Biden took over the White House in 2009, a general partnership formed that brought together Hunter Biden, son of then-Vice President Joe Biden, Christopher Heinz, stepson of then-Sen. John Kerry, and Devon Archer, a classmate of Heinz’s from Yale.\\nBut all three did not participate in all of the deals undertaken under the Rosemont Seneca umbrella, with separate corporations formed for some deals.\\nSuch was the case with Biden and Archer’s foray into China. Heinz’s attorney told The Hill that Heinz had “no operating role” in Rosemont Seneca and had nothing to do with any of the deals in question in China.\\nHunter Biden’s role is also not as straightforward as the president and Giuliani say, according to Hunter Biden’s attorney. But it is true that Hunter Biden and Archer made business overtures to high-ranking Chinese fund leaders as early as 2010.\\nAs conservative author Peter Schweizer details in his book “Secret Empires,” Biden and Archer, along with James Bulger of the consultancy firm the Thornton Group, took several meetings in 2010 with high-profile business and government interests in China. (As Giuliani said, James Bulger is the nephew of mobster Whitey Bulger, but he’s also the son of former Massachusetts state Sen. Billy Bulger.)\\nSchweizer came across an account of the meetings posted by the Thornton Group — in Chinese — in which Chinese executives expressed their “warm welcome” to the “Thornton Group, with its US partner Rosemont Seneca chairman Hunter Biden (second son of the now Vice President Joe Biden).” According to the Thornton Group’s account — a copy of which Schweizer emailed to us — the purpose of the meetings was to “explore the possibility of commercial cooperation and opportunity.”\\nFlash forward three years to June 2013, and according to the New Yorker, Archer, Jonathan Li — who ran a Chinese private equity fund, Bohai Capital — and other partners “signed a memorandum of understanding to create” a cross-border private equity fund “which they named BHR Partners, and, in November, they signed contracts related to the deal.” (Some of those entities that met in China with Archer and Biden back in 2010, including representatives from the National Council of Social Security Fund and the Postal Savings Bank of China, ended up investing in the fund managed by BHR.)\\nIn December 2013, Hunter Biden and one of his daughters flew on Air Force Two with Joe Biden to China, where the elder Biden was on a diplomatic mission. Hunter Biden’s attorney, George Mesires, told the New York Times that Hunter Biden went along because his daughter had been invited and needed a chaperone.\\nAlthough Hunter Biden told the New Yorker he conducted no business while in China, he did arrange for a photo op with Li and his father, Joe Biden, in a hotel lobby. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker that the meeting with Li, who would soon after become CEO of BHR, was purely social, and that he did not meet with any Chinese government officials about the fund on that trip. Mesires told NBC Hunter Biden he did not conduct any business on the trip.\\nMesires also told NBC News that BHR’s initial formation documents were filed in November 2013 — the month before the China trip — but that the business was officially launched with a business license issued 10 days after the visit. Hunter Biden was named to its board of directors. Archer was a vice chairman of the company and sat on its investment committee.\\nAccording to a July 10, 2014, Wall Street Journal article, “A consortium of foreign and Chinese private-equity firms is aiming to raise about $1.5 billion to invest abroad, with the yuan-denominated portion of the fund to be converted to U.S. dollars through Shanghai’s free-trade zone.”\\nWall Street Journal, July 10, 2014: The fund — launched by Chinese asset managers Bohai Industrial Investment Fund Management Co. and Harvest Fund Management Co. alongside U.S. investment and advisory firms Rosemont Seneca Partners and Thornton Group LLC — started fundraising in the second quarter, and has raised its target to $1.5 billion from an original $1 billion plan, a spokesman at Bank of China International Holdings Ltd. said. BOCI is one of the largest stakeholders in Bohai. The Bohai-Harvest fund is likely one of the biggest Sino-foreign collaborations [between Chinese partners and foreign ones] in private equity to take advantage of the free-trade zone’s benefits in converting yuan to dollars that can then be invested in foreign companies. The funds are raising a combination of yuan and U.S. dollars. The effort is the latest example private equity pushing boundaries in an area that China hopes will help drive the country’s economic transformation. Normally, China restricts free conversion of its currency. Bohai and its partners are expected to finish fundraising by the end of this year, according to BOCI’s spokesman and Lindsay Wright, co-chief executive officer of Harvest Capital Management Co., the subsidiary under Harvest that will hold a direct stake in the joint fund.\\nAccording to the article, BOCI and Harvest both declined to say how much had been raised at that time. We don’t know whether the $1.5 billion goal was ever reached. Nonetheless, that’s the origin of the figure cited by Trump and Giuliani. (BHR’s website says the assets it now manages are worth over $2.1 billion.)\\nHunter Biden’s Role\\nHunter Biden’s attorney says Hunter Biden neither created the management company nor had an ownership stake until well after his father left office.\\n“BHR (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Company (‘BHR’) is an investment management company that was formed in 2013,” George Mesires told us via email. “Hunter did not form BHR, was not an initial owner of BHR, and did not own any interest in BHR until October 2017, after his father had left government service. BHR was capitalized with approximately $4.2 million USD from various sources, not $1.5 billion. Hunter did not acquire any interest in BHR until October 2017 when he acquired a 10% interest, which has a $420,000 capital commitment.”\\nTrump and Hunter Biden’s attorney are talking past each other a bit. Trump says Hunter Biden “walk[ed] out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund.” Biden’s attorney dismissed that figure, saying “BHR was capitalized with approximately $4.2 million USD from various sources, not $1.5 billion.” The $1.5 billion figure refers to the size of the funds raised for investments.\\nHunter Biden did serve on BHR’s original board of directors while his father was vice president, but Mesires told the Washington Post that Biden was on the board of the advisory firm that did not directly invest, but instead advised those who did.\\nMesires told us, “Hunter has not received any return on his investment or compensation on account of his position on the board of directors.”\\nA BHR representative told the New Yorker in July that although Hunter Biden served on the board, he was not a signatory to the BHR deal, and that the deal wasn’t with Rosemont Seneca Partners, but rather with a holding company, established solely by Archer.\\nCorporate registration records in China — captured by Schweizer in May — show that “Rosemont Seneca Thornton LLC” owned a 30% stake in BHR. We could not confirm if that was the holding company to which the BHR representatives referred. And Biden’s attorney did not respond to our inquiries seeking details about that.\\nSchweizer points to a screen grab from a 2016 version of the BHR website that lists Rosemont Seneca Partners as a “sponsor” of BHR.\\nBHR website, Sept. 7, 2016: Formed in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone in December 2013 as its first cross-border investment private equity firm, BHR is the cross-border investment arm of Bohai Industrial Investment Fund Management Co., Ltd. (“Bohai Capital”). Our other sponsors include Harvest Fund Management Co., Ltd (‘Harvest”), Rosemont Seneca Partners (“RSP”), Thornton Group LLC (“Thornton”) and our management team. We also enjoy the support of Bank of China, China Development Bank Capital, National Council of Social Security Fund, China Life, Postal Savings Bank of China, among others, as our suite of legacy shareholders through Bohai Capital.\\nBut according to Hunter Biden’s attorney, Hunter Biden derived no financial benefit from the deal at that time. He was acting as an unpaid director advising investors in the fund.\\nMesires told the New York Times that while Hunter Biden now has a 10% stake in BHR, which he acquired through a company he created named Skaneateles LLC, “there have been no distributions to the shareholders since Hunter has been an equity owner.”\\nBut that doesn’t mean Biden won’t eventually make millions from the deal. Steven Kaplan, who conducts research on issues in private equity, venture capital, entrepreneurial finance, corporate governance and corporate finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, told us that a private equity fund with $2 billion under management will typically generate fees over its life of hundreds of millions of dollars.\\n“It is difficult to imagine, if not incomprehensible, that a 10% stake in those economics is worth only $420K,” Kaplan told us via email. “The distinction they appear to be making is they capitalized the management company with $4.2 M even if the fund manages $2 B. The value of that management company is likely far in excess of $4.2 M if they are managing $2 B.”\\nKaplan pointed to two large publicly traded private equity firms for reference, both of which have a market value of about 10% of the assets under their management. Using that as a rough guide, that would put the value of Hunter Biden’s share closer to $20 million, he said.\\nThere are still some unanswered questions about Hunter Biden and his role in the BHR deal, and his attorney did not get back to us when we had follow-up questions. We don’t know details, for example, about the BHR representative’s claim to the New Yorker about Archer alone setting up a separate holding company apart from Rosemont Seneca Partners to make the initial BHR deal, though the fact that Hunter Biden used a separate corporation to acquire a 10% stake in BHR in 2017 may suggest he did not have any ownership stake prior to that.\\nAlthough some may speculate about Hunter Biden’s activities while on a diplomatic trip with his father in China, Hunter Biden told the Washington Post earlier this year, “At no time have I discussed with my father the company’s business or my board service.” And Joe Biden in Iowa recently said, “I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.”\\nIn an op-ed for the New York Times published on Oct. 9, Schweizer said Hunter Biden didn’t do anything illegal in the China deal. While the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits a U.S.-owned company from hiring the children of foreign government officials “in the hopes of currying favor with their powerful parents,” Schweizer wrote, it is not a violation if a foreign company hires or does business with the family members of American politicians. Schweizer argues, however, that such “cronyism” should be illegal.\\n“It gives the politically connected class enormously tempting opportunities for self-dealing, the sort of thing that is blatantly illegal in almost any other context,” Schweizer wrote, adding that Biden landed a deal in China that “he was apparently unqualified to score save for one thing: his father.”\\nHunter Biden is not the first child of a prominent politician to be accused of having ties to a company doing business with a foreign country. Indeed, similar questions have been raised about Trump’s own family members.\\nThe president is free to question whether Hunter Biden capitalized on his father’s name to insert himself into a deal that involves investments by the Chinese government. But he goes beyond that to make unsubstantiated claims that Hunter Biden made “millions and millions” from China while his father was vice president and that he hitched a ride on Air Force Two to secure a $1.5 billion investment deal.\\nBiden’s attorney claims that Hunter Biden made no money off the deal while his father served as vice president, and has yet to see any return on his investment. We cannot verify either statement, and we can’t say how much Hunter Biden might ultimately make from his 10% stake in BHR. But while Trump has called on China to open an investigation, there has been no evidence presented to date that suggests either Biden did anything illegal.'], 'https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2020/heres-why-you-should-be-willing-to-believe-anonymous-sources/': ['poynter', 'Here’s why you should be willing to believe anonymous sources', 'Tom Jones, Tom Jones Is Poynter S Senior Media Writer For Poynter.Org.

Critics of The Atlantic story are lashing out at its use of anonymous sources.\\n“We all have to use anonymous sources, especially in a climate where the president of the United States tries to actively intimidate,” Goldberg told CNN’s Brian Stelter on this weekend’s “Reliable Sources.” “These are not people who are anonymous to me.”\\nIn the same episode, famed Washington Post reporter Carl Bernstein, who worked with Bob Woodward to break many of the Watergate stories, told Stelter, “Almost all 200 of our stories about Watergate were based on anonymous sourcing.”\\nAnd, he said, it’s critical to use anonymous sources when reporting on this White House.\\n“Reporting is almost uniformly based on anonymous sourcing in part because that’s the only way we can get to the truth,” Bernstein said.\\nFirst, let’s be clear about this: News organizations would prefer for sources to go on the record. They don’t like using anonymous sources but often have no other choice. Sources don’t want to be named out of fear of retribution — either from those they are talking about or from the general public.\\nThe problem with anonymous sources is that the public might not trust that the source actually exists or that the source is truly reliable. Whenever a news organization uses an anonymous source, they are telling their audience, “Trust us. We cannot tell you who this person is, but we can tell you that we believe they are credible, they know what they’re talking about, that we believe what they have to say and you should, too.”\\nBut, frequently, the audience doesn’t want to hand over that trust. Often, it’s because they don’t want the story to be true. Using last week’s example, Trump supporters might rather dismiss the story as being false instead of admitting that it could be true. And if no one is publicly putting their name on the allegations, dismissing it is easier to do.\\nAnd even audiences willing to admit that the sources exist, naturally, would prefer to know who those sources are so they can judge for themselves just how much stock to put into their information. (To use an example, the term “White House source” potentially could refer to almost anyone, from a senior advisor to a low-level staffer — and one could be in the know more than the other.)\\nWhile I cannot speak for every news organization out there, I can tell you that, in my experience, the threshold for using anonymous sources is very high. It’s a last resort and, typically, the information provided by an anonymous source is confirmed by at least one other source.\\nIs it possible for news organizations to make up an anonymous source? Sure, anything is possible. But it’s highly unlikely. Nothing is more crucial to a news organization than its trustworthiness, and that could be ruined forever if it was ever caught making up sources. News outlets know that and would be loath to risk such a thing. And because of the editing and vetting process, and the number of people involved in that process, it’s nearly impossible to make up sources or quotes or to run a story that the news outlet doesn’t believe to be true.\\nWhile media cynics might not want to believe this, those who work for reputable news organizations do take their code of ethics seriously and should be given the benefit of the doubt until they prove otherwise. (The key words there are “reputable news organizations.”)\\nStill, news organizations need to realize that as long as they use anonymous sources, there will be a segment of the population that simply will not trust the information in the story. That is the price to be paid when quoting someone anonymously.\\nMore on the Atlantic story\\nIt was somewhat curious to see Fox News tie itself into a knot with the Atlantic story. Fox News’ pundits had a problem with The Atlantic story even though Fox News’ national security correspondent, Jennifer Griffin, went on the air to confirm Trump’s disrespect of the military.\\nContributor Geraldo Rivera called it a “hit job.” Fox News’ Pete Hegseth tweeted, “This Atlantic ‘story’ is nothing but a textbook Leftist hit-job. Always anonymous. Always coordinated. And, as we’ve seen with all the other anti-Trump hoaxes, always fabricated. The Left knows how @realDonaldTrump defends & revers our vets/military—so they attack his strength.”\\nOn the air, Hegseth said, “Always anonymous sources. This happened, supposedly, two years ago, now we’re finding out about it 60 days before the election. By the way, the Trump campaign has scores of people on the record saying that’s of course not what we heard or saw. This story in The Atlantic has been catnip for haters of the president.”\\nHegseth needs to be careful with this “anonymous sources” rhetoric, seeing how Fox News uses their share of “sources said” to back their stories. In fact, many noted that Fox News’ John Roberts used “sources” to shoot down the idea that Trump ever said anything to disrespect the military.\\nKudos, however, to Griffin for doing her job and reporting what she learned. And, kudos, too, for Fox News’ Bret Baier for standing up for Griffin while filling in for Chris Wallace as moderator on “Fox News Sunday.” The Washington Post’s Jeremy Barr also pointed out others at Fox News who stood up for Griffin.\\nOne last thing\\nOne last thought about The Atlantic story. This is another thing that happens when you have a blockbuster story: It doesn’t go away. As Goldberg told Stelter on CNN, “I would fully expect more reporting to come out about this and more confirmation and new pieces of information in the coming days and weeks.”\\nJournalism that matters\\nThe Washington Post had a blockbuster story over the weekend. The Post’s Aaron C. Davis, Amy Gardner and Jon Swaine reported that Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a major donor and supporter of President Trump and the Republican Party, created an environment at his former business where employees felt pressured to donate to the campaigns of GOP candidates and then were later “reimbursed” with bonuses. This allegedly happened at DeJoy’s former company, New Breed Logistics.\\nDavid Young — a longtime human resources director at DeJoy’s company who had access to payroll records at New Breed from the late 1990s until he retired in 2013 — said, “Louis was a national fundraiser for the Republican Party. He asked employees for money. We gave him the money, and then he reciprocated by giving us big bonuses. When we got our bonuses, let’s just say they were bigger, they exceeded expectations — and that covered the tax and everything else.”\\nThe Post spoke to other employees at New Breed who confirmed the allegations. One former employee told the Post, “He would ask employees to make contributions at the same time that he would say, ‘I’ll get it back to you down the road.’”\\nA spokesperson for DeJoy told the Post that DeJoy was not aware that any of his former employees felt pressured to donate to any political campaigns.\\nThe Post’s Amber Phillips has a helpful piece on the legal lines that DeJoy might have crossed, including covering up the sources of political donations, using corporate money to cover up donations and potentially coercing employees to give.\\nSo why do I mention this story here in a media newsletter? Two reasons: one, it’s really good journalism that you should read. But, two, this is the kind of tag-team journalism that is so valuable to readers. A group of reporters puts together an outstanding, well-reported piece and then there’s easy-to-digest analysis to tell you why this all matters.\\nThis is journalism done right.\\nAn emotional moment\\nESPN’s College GameDay is one of the best sports studio shows ever. But, this past weekend might have produced the most emotional moment in the history of the show, which debuted in 1987. Analyst Kirk Herbstreit broke down while talking about social injustice.\\nHe quoted Ben Franklin, saying, “‘Justice will not be served until those who are unaffected are as outraged as those who are.’ … That’s what I mean when I think the Black community is hurting. If you’ve listened — the word empathy and compassion over these last four months — how do you listen to these stories and not feel pain and not want to help?”\\nYou need to watch the segment to understand just how emotional Herbstreit became. Powerful stuff. The Athletic’s Richard Deitsch has more on how it all came together. (Note: the story is behind a paywall.)\\n“College GameDay” producer Jim Gaiero told Deitsch, “I was crying as I was counting us down to the break. It was a powerful moment. The whole crew was emotionally spent. There was still nine minutes left in the show, but I think the whole crew realized they had just been part of something.”\\nMeanwhile, this was also noteworthy from Saturday’s show: Longtime “College GameDay” analyst Lee Corso said that college football should be erring on the side of caution and not be playing right now because of the coronavirus.\\n“I agree with the Big Ten and the Pac-12 about not playing college football this season because of the ‘what ifs?’ Basically, there are a number of people — thousands of people involved in college football,” Corso said. “I would not play football until February 2021.”\\nSports Twilight Zone\\nIf you’re a sports fan like me, this week is when the world really felt turned upside down. This past weekend saw all of the following: the Kentucky Derby, the U.S. Open tennis tournament, the Tour de France, the Stanley Cup hockey playoffs, the NBA playoffs, Major League Baseball, NASCAR’s playoffs, a PGA tournament and college football. The NFL kicks off Thursday night and then there’s a full slate of games this weekend.\\nMost of this is without fans. Credit the networks for not only juggling their schedules to fit all these events on TV, but for continuing to produce television worth watching in these truly bizarre times.\\nBy the way, overnight TV ratings for the Kentucky Derby, normally the first Triple Crown race run in May, were good and bad. The bad: The race portion on NBC averaged 8.3 million viewers — the lowest on record, dating back to 1988. The good: It was the most-watched sporting event on TV since the NFL Draft in April. Again, chalk it up to the odd sporting schedule of 2020.\\nGannett’s big move\\nGannett announced this morning that Mayur Gupta will be the company’s new chief marketing and strategy officer. Gannett says he will be responsible for “driving the vision and strategy as the company transforms\\nto a subscription-led content business. This continuous evolution in a digital economy will strengthen Gannett’s mission to build trusted local communities at the intersection of the organization’s direct-to-\\nconsumer and business-to-business endeavors.

Lindsey Graham (R–S.C.) gave a performance that reminds us of just how deeply Trumpism has corrupted the Republican Party.\\nGraham, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, was nominally the man in charge of the committee\\'s hearing on Monday—a hearing in which Attorney General William Barr offered his testimony and answered questions about his handling of the release of the report written by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller.\\nRight from the start, Graham made clear that he did not see the hearing as an opportunity to clear up the remaining confusion about key differences between Barr\\'s initial statements on the Mueller report and the details in the Mueller report itself. Instead of seeking answers, Graham picked up where Barr had left off in doing damage control for the president.\\n\"After all this time and all this money, Mr. Mueller and his team concluded there was no collusion,\" said Graham, borrowing from Trump\\'s favorite characterization of the Mueller report\\'s outcome.\\n\"As to obstruction of justice, Mr. Mueller left it to Mr. Barr to decide,\" Graham continued. \"After two years and all this time, he said to Mr. Barr \\'you decide\\' and Mr. Barr did.\"\\nIncredibly, that\\'s an interpretation—some might say spin—that\\'s even more generous to Trump than Barr\\'s original framing of the Mueller report, which Mueller has criticized for not fully capturing the \"context, nature, and substance\" of his investigation.\\nGraham\\'s claim that Mueller found \"no collusion\" is an oversimplification, at best, of the first half of the report, which details numerous attempts by both the Trump campaign and the Russian government to find common ground during 2016. Whether you agree with the senator\\'s assessment likely depends on your existing opinions about what, exactly, constitutes \"collusion.\"\\nBut Graham is objectively wrong to claim that Mueller left the obstruction question for Barr \"to decide.\" In fact, Mueller explicitly tossed that specific ball into Congress\\' court.\\n\"The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the President\\'s corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law,\" the Mueller report states.\\nThat\\'s probably the right thing to do since longstanding Department of Justice precedent says a sitting president cannot be indicted. Mueller\\'s report outlines 10 times that Trump attempted to interfere with the investigation—going as far as telling then-White House counsel Don McGahn \"Mueller has to go. Call me back when you do it.\" Mueller was allowed to continue his investigation only because McGahn flat-out refused to follow a direct order from the President of the United States.\\nThat same pattern emerges again and again in the Mueller report\\'s damning second volume. \"The President\\'s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests,\" the Mueller report says.\\nHow did Graham describe Trump\\'s actions?\\n\"The president never did anything to stop Mueller from doing his job,\" Graham said Wednesday.\\nMembers of Congress are free to draw their own conclusions from the Mueller report, of course, and that is exactly what Mueller appears to have intended by tossing the obstruction question into their court.\\nAnd to be fair, the Mueller investigation and report have driven nearly everyone in Washington to the brink of insanity. When Trump\\'s critics inflate details of the report to create wild conspiracy theories completely unsupported by the facts, they are doing an equally significant disservice to the dialogue surrounding the president and what he may have done or not done with regard to Russia and the subsequent investigation.\\nStill, Graham\\'s mischaracterization of both the report\\'s findings and the legal process used to arrive at them is a telling indication that GOP leadership remains loyal to Trump\\'s cult of personality.\\nGraham\\'s \"evolution\" during the Trump years has been more dramatic than most, but his performance on Wednesday was on par with how many other Republicans have handled the explosive details in the Mueller report. Instead of using his immense power as the chairman of a powerful Senate committee to determine whether Trump\\'s presidency should continue, or at least to get straight answers about why Barr apparently misled Americans about the content of Mueller\\'s report, Graham is now making a show of rolling over for a president that he once said was a \"kook\" and \"unfit for office.\"'], 'https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/trump-the-squad-and-the-standard-definition-of-racism': ['newyorker.com', 'Trump, the Squad, and the “Standard Definition” of Racism', 'Condé Nast, Doreen St. Félix', datetime.datetime(2019, 7, 16, 16, 9, 23), 'It’s useful, always, to consult the stylebook. Earlier this year, the Associated Press belatedly revised its entry on race, which now reads, “Do not use racially charged or similar terms as euphemisms for racist or racism when the latter terms are truly applicable.” The recommendation is a concession to clarity, not to passion or politics. The regulators of news language recognize that to evaluate a person, an event, or a phenomenon as racist is to do just that: to evaluate and observe the situation, and to listen to the facts. Not to breed doubt or inaccuracy where precision and lean language ought to live—e.g., the sky is blue. Or: the President is racist.\\nDonald Trump’s tweets, this past weekend, were of vintage racist stock. To tell someone to “go back” to the “places from which they came,” as Trump did, clearly addressing four congresswomen of color—Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib—is stereotypical, lowest-common-denominator racism, embedded in familiar scripts and powered by old tropes. Polls will inform us whether Trump’s open expression of his virulent prejudices will cause his approval ratings to drop, as they did after his “both sides” comments about a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville. But whites sympathetic to his nationalist project are not the only American constituency listening. “It is the lot of so many immigrants, children of immigrants, and people of color in this country to wonder whether we can ever truly belong here,” Michael Luo, the editor of newyorker.com, wrote yesterday, recalling his own experience being told to “go back to China.”\\nOn Monday, Trump doubled down on his comments. He accused his targets of the real “racist hatred,” extravagantly wielding the white-nationalist talking points of “reverse” racism. On Tuesday, he added, “Those Tweets were NOT Racist. I don’t have a Racist bone in my body!” In response, even those who recognize the tweets for what they are have got tangled in their rebukes of Trump. Some naïvely emphasized that Tlaib, Ocasio-Cortez, and Pressley were actually born in America, and that Omar is a naturalized citizen, as if the President were speaking from a place of misinformation rather than bald incitement. Unnerved, some Republicans have spoken out against Trump, but all except two have avoided calling his comments racist. “I don’t find them racist,” the Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said, declaring himself “not concerned.” Senator Susan Collins released a statement saying that the tweets were “way over the line.” Brit Hume, at Fox, tweeted that Trump’s comments were “nativist” and “politically stupid,” but that they didn’t meet the “standard definition of racist, a word so recklessly flung around these days that its actual meaning is being lost.”\\nThis is the dull semantics of racism. The white conservative twists the discursive field so that he is the sane arbiter of what is or isn’t racist; everyone else is frivolous and excessive, “recklessly” invoking the most sacrilegious offense. This logic rests on the illusion that racism is mythically rare, that “racist” is a dangerous slur rather than a common condition. Trump’s tweets were prompted by the disagreement last week between Nancy Pelosi and the Squad, as the four congresswomen have come to be called, over the Squad’s opposition to a border-spending bill. In an interview with Maureen Dowd, Pelosi spoke dismissively of her younger colleagues, saying, “They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got.” When Ocasio-Cortez pointed out Pelosi’s “persistent singling out” of the “newly elected women of color” in government, there was an outcry among establishment Democrats and analysts, who rebuked A.O.C. for talking out of turn and for daring to tarnish Pelosi with the implication of prejudice. Ocasio-Cortez is a deliberate speaker, and she did not call Pelosi a racist, but her invocation of race was enough to cause a flurry of defensive rhetoric. Trump seized on the moment of infighting to weaponize Ocasio-Cortez’s remarks: “Whenever confronted, they call their adversaries, including Nancy Pelosi, ‘RACIST,’ ” he tweeted on Sunday.\\nThere persists a wrongheaded and entrenched wisdom among politicians and élite journalists that to call something racist is to violate etiquette. “Trump Fans the Flames of a Racial Fire,” a Times headline about the tweets read on Sunday. It was Charles Blow’s opinion piece, titled “Trump’s Tweets Prove That He Is a Raging Racist,” that spoke objectively. Pelosi’s disapproval of the tactics of the Squad has to do with the preservation of an establishment style, the old guard attempting to rein in the new. But Trump’s attacks test the stubbornness of entrenched mores. House Democrats are preparing a resolution to formally condemn Trump’s tweets; its text begins by referring to “President Trump’s racist comments directed at Members of Congress.” This is not only condemnatory but also plainly descriptive. Too much superstition attends the deployment of “racist.” The bar for its just use isn’t very high to clear.'], 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/its-over-divided-senate-acquits-trump-of-both-impeachment-charges': ['washingtonexaminer.com', 'Trump acquitted: Senate ends impeachment saga', '', datetime.datetime(2020, 2, 5, 21, 20, 10), 'The Senate voted to acquit President Trump of two articles of impeachment, ending a monthslong effort by Democrats to remove him from office.\\nDemocrats fell far short of winning the needed 67 votes to convict the president of either the abuse of power or the obstruction of Congress charges.

Mitt Romney, voted with Democrats on the abuse of power charge, but no Democrats voted to acquit the president. The Senate voted 52-48 to acquit the president of the abuse of power charge and 53-47 to acquit the president of the obstruction of Congress charge.\\nThe acquittal ended a historic impeachment process that began with a late-September House investigation into the president’s decision to block security aid intended for Ukraine.\\nDemocrats alleged Trump used the power of his office to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden.

Whether anger at the social media site is justified, the debate shouldn’t obscure the obvious: The bigger problem is the president.\\nTwitter provided only an apology this week to the husband of Lori Klausutis after he petitioned the company to take down the “vicious lies” Mr. Trump has spread about his wife, who passed away in 2001 when she fainted and hit her head in the office of then-Rep. Joe Scarborough (R-Fla.). Twitter did, however, take action against an entirely separate set of offensive tweets from the commander in chief: false claims that mail-in ballots are fraudulent, to which the platform applied a fact-checking label with a link to authoritative information.\\nThe story is, admittedly, a little head-spinning. Twitter has rules for offensive posts; it exempts world leaders from most of them; but it claims that those exemptions aren’t relevant here, because the tweets related to Ms. Klausutis don’t violate any terms of service about harassment, as critics allege. Twitter is looking to its rules about misinformation instead. The platform rarely takes down misleading content, but it has started to attach fact-checking labels in areas where confusion can become dangerous. One is “civic integrity,” which is why the mail-in ballot tweets were addressed. Apparently, Twitter so far hasn’t developed labeling guidelines for false allegations of murder.\\nAdvertisement\\nWhat ought to be more head-spinning than all of this, however, is that the man in the Oval Office spends his days slinging out lies so copious that Twitter has multiple options for policing in the first place. Equally appalling was Mr. Trump’s reaction to Twitter’s timid fact-check: He threatened to “close them down,” having cried earlier this month that the “Radical Left is in total command & control” of social media sites. Twitter’s policies are messy, but that’s in part because the company is scrambling to serve a country whose most powerful public messenger is also its least responsible — all while maintaining the dedication to free expression that makes it a space for everybody.\\nFollow Editorial Board 's opinions Follow\\nBelieving in democracy means believing in the ability of the people to choose their leaders with full knowledge of who they are, and for America fully to know who Mr. Trump is, his most despicable broadcasts must remain within the citizenry’s reach. Yet his messages are not only instructive in their vileness: They also have potential to do great damage. Twitter should develop a more coherent framework to deal with speech by world leaders; with real-world harm, including harassment; and with misinformation — and to articulate how they knit together in this case and in others. But it’s no wonder that its policies are a muddle.

He’s also suggested Democrats shouldn’t be allowed to call new witnesses as they attempt to present their case.\\nThe White House lashed out at the move. “House Democrats have run a fatally flawed process with fake facts, and now they want to deny the President his day in court with another procedural maneuver that proves anew they have no case,” said Eric Ueland, Trump’s top congressional liaison to Congress.\\nPelosi’s remarks follow similar comments from House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking lawmaker in the House, who said Democrats must discuss a last-ditch gambit to delay sending articles of impeachment to the Senate and prevent the Republican-controlled chamber from summarily discarding the case against Trump.\\nIn recent weeks, some legal scholars have suggested Speaker Nancy Pelosi could consider refusing to transmit the articles of impeachment that passed the House on Wednesday to the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has declared he is coordinating trial strategy with the White House.\\nThough the request initially seemed to have little currency on Capitol Hill, it gained momentum in recent days as McConnell has continued to make clear he has little interest in serving as an impartial overseer of the Senate trial.\\nHoyer said Democratic colleagues have approached him in recent days, citing an op-ed by constitutional lawyer Laurence Tribe in which he calls on Democrats to delay sending impeachment articles to the Senate until McConnell agrees to run a fairer process.\\n“Under the current circumstances, such a proceeding would fail to render a meaningful verdict of acquittal,” Tribe wrote. Notably, House Judiciary Committee Democrats huddled with Tribe earlier this month as they practiced behind closed doors for their series of impeachment hearings.\\nPelosi’s remarks, which were barely audible above the clatter of camera shutters, were so unexpected that they prompted reporters to shout over each other, interrupting the speaker at times and generating confusion about the next steps in the impeachment process.\\n“So you may not send them?” one reporter interjected, to which Pelosi responded: “You’re asking me, ‘So are we all going to go out and play in the snow?’ That has not been part of our conversations.”\\nThe last-minute twist was a stunning coda to the monthslong House impeachment process that had been meticulously choreographed by Pelosi and other senior Democrats. After the news conference, Pelosi huddled with top committee chairs leading Trump-focused investigations, and they emerged with a consistent message: The only story that matters is the president has been impeached.\\n“The only thing that matters is the president of the United States was impeached today,” said Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). As for the Senate? “One step at a time,” she said.\\n“We defended the Constitution and we defended our democracy,” said Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.). “Right now, that’s the story,” he said.\\nSome Democrats said they became convinced a delay in transmitting articles was under consideration when House leaders decided against naming impeachment managers — the set of lawmakers who would argue their case on the Senate floor — until an undetermined later date.\\nWhen President Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998, House leaders identified their impeachment managers the same day. But Pelosi instead will be empowered to pick managers at her discretion and without a deadline.\\n“The rule will allow the speaker to name managers at any point after the articles pass,” a senior House Democratic aide said, noting that the House needs to name managers in order to transmit the articles to the Senate.\\nRep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) said he’s approached every member of House leadership about the idea and received responses ranging from interest to outright support. He said Pelosi, in particular, “indicated she was interested and considering it.”\\n“As long as we have the articles of impeachment under our control, we have an opportunity to prevent a travesty,” Blumenauer said.\\nBlumenauer argued that the House could use the delay to continue to build on its evidence for impeachment, and possibly to score additional legal victories that could unlock troves of new evidence and witness testimony that the Trump administration has withheld from Congress. Some of those court cases could be decided within weeks.\\n“You can continue to build the record, you can get information and you argue for fairness and don’t surrender until it’s clear that that is in the best interest of the process,” Blumenauer said.\\nIn his remarks to reporters, Hoyer emphasized that early discussions about the timing of transmitting articles of impeachment to the Senate are “not in the context” of Tribe’s proposal. But he said colleagues keep raising it.\\n“People have read that article, discussed it. People have come up to me, discussed it,” he said, adding, “We will talk about it in some point in time. It’s within the speaker’s purview, obviously, she’ll make that decision. And I also think she’ll do it in discussions with McConnell and [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer.”\\nMarianne Levine contributed to this report.'], 'https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/mar/19/blaming-donald-trump-for-the-new-zealand-massacre-/': ['washingtontimes.com', 'Blaming Donald Trump for the New Zealand massacre is nonsense', 'The Washington Times Https, John R. Lott Jr.', datetime.datetime(2019, 3, 19, 21, 6, 11), 'OPINION:\\nThe national Sunday morning talk shows blamed President Trump for the New Zealand massacre that left 50 dead. CNN’s Jake Tapper warned: “I don’t think moderate Republicans are doing enough to hold President Trump accountable for his rhetoric.” NBC’s Chuck Todd noted supposed parallels to the killer’s rhetoric, and asked: “When the president uses the term ‘invaders,’ does that dehumanize to the point where it can get misused?”\\nThe media made Mr. Trump its singular target, but not even Democrats were completely spared from the frenzy of critical reactions. In a viral video, an angry NYU student confronted Chelsea Clinton and blamed her “rhetoric” for the New Zealand massacre. What was Ms. Clinton’s offense? She criticized Rep. Ilhan Omar, Minnesota Democrat, for making anti-Semitic remarks.\\nBlaming Mr. Trump or even Chelsea Clinton is nonsensical. The media acts like mass public shootings in other countries are something new, but they are actually much more common outside of the United States. And, well before Mr. Trump became president, foreign shooting, bombing and vehicle attacks were increasing in frequency at a much faster rate.\\nResearch by the Crime Prevention Research Center, over which I preside, shows that there were 2,354 attacks and at least 4,880 shooters outside of the United States from 1998 through 2015. This excludes incidents that occurred in the course of guerrilla or civil wars. In contrast, our country had 53 attacks and 57 shooters. By our count, the United States accounts for 1.49 percent of mass public shooting murders, 2.20 percent of attacks, and less than 1.15 percent of shooters. All of these figures are much smaller than the United States’ 4.6 percent share of the world population.\\nOf the 97 countries in which we have identified mass public shootings, the United States ranks 64th per capita in frequency of attacks and 65th in fatalities. Major European countries such as Norway, Finland, France, Switzerland and Russia all have at least 25 percent higher per capita rates of mass public shooting murders.\\nAlthough Americans are concerned by the increased frequency and severity of mass public shootings at home, the rest of the world is experiencing much larger increases. Including all of the attacks in the United States up until the end of last year, the per capita frequency of foreign mass public shootings since 1998 has grown 291 percent faster than in the United States. The growth rate of mass public shooting murders was well more than twice as fast.\\nBombings across the world that soared by five-fold from 2007 to 2015 have also dropped by 40 percent over the next two years. It is hardly a pattern that fits the media narrative for responsibility. Worldwide mass killings from vehicle attacks began increasing in 2016 before Mr. Trump became president.\\nThe media also conveniently ignores the killer’s manifesto with his stated objective. When he asks himself if “won’t your attack result in calls for the removal of gun rights” for New Zealanders and Americans, he responded: “Yes, that is the plan all along” And within a day, politicians in both countries were doing what the killer wanted. The New Zealand government has already promised to enact a complete ban on semi-automatic guns.\\nThis isn’t even the first time that mass public shooters have supported gun control. The Columbine school killers were also gun control advocates.\\nThe media consistently fails to note that these attacks keep occurring where people aren’t allowed to defend themselves. No one talks about how lives may have been saved in the New Zealand massacre or the previous day’s school shooting in Suzano, Brazil, if people had been able to protect themselves.\\nGun control has not been the answer. Brazil has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world, with less than one percent of adults possessing a license to own a gun (most are police officers). In New Zealand, just 250,000 (6.56 percent) out of 3.81 million adults have such licenses.\\nIt is simply a mistake for the media to see a significant share of these attacks as having been egged on by political rhetoric. Doing so only serves to divide people even further.\\n• John Lott is the president of the Crime Prevention Research Center and a former chief economist at the U.S. Sentencing Commission.'], 'https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/478503-gop-senator-2020-candidates-must-recuse-themselves-from-impeachment-trial': ['thehill.com', 'GOP senator: 2020 candidates must recuse themselves from impeachment trial', 'Jordain Carney, Hours Ago, Pm Et, Days Ago, Am Et', datetime.datetime(2020, 1, 15, 23, 56), 'Sen.

Had he let the investigation run its course, he would have looked less guilty, would have retained more of his best staff, and would have seen the investigation end sooner.\\nThe firing of FBI Director James Comey appears to have come in a fit of pique over collusion questions. It also triggered the special counsel investigation. Trump then allegedly instructed White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders to lie about why he fired Comey, claiming the director was deeply unpopular at the FBI.\\nTrump had another tantrum when he learned of that investigation, according to former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The president accurately declared himself debilitated — he used a more colorful word — by the investigation, saying it would keep him from accomplishing anything for years.\\nSubsequently, he tried repeatedly to interfere with the investigation, according to witnesses. He allegedly urged Sessions to un-recuse himself, told aide Corey Lewandowski to lean on Sessions to do so, told White House counsel Don McGahn that Mueller had to go, and then told McGahn to deny, falsely, that he had issued such an order.\\nMcGahn, the report says, blocked the effort to fire Mueller and refused to lie about it. This sort of scene plays out repeatedly in the Mueller report, leading to its conclusion: “The President’s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded [him] declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.”\\nAlthough it looks as though Trump wasn’t trying to cover up any collusion and never crossed the line into criminal obstruction, he did try to undermine an investigation and repeatedly pushed others to lie or deflect in order to defend himself. This reflects his disregard for the federal law enforcement apparatus of which he is the constitutionally designated head.\\nThat is unbecoming and worrisome, and it is unethical to press others to lie, even when the lies are not under oath.\\nBut demonstrating unbecoming and worrisome vices in our president was not the task of the special counsel. The investigation was about whether he colluded with Russia. He didn't, and nor did his campaign.

Eisenhower, who named the retreat Camp David after his father and grandson, met with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev there in 1959. At a point of high Cold War tension, the two leaders made some progress, such as agreeing to open talks on the administration of war-torn Berlin. But much of the good will was scuttled when an American U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union months later.\\nMiddle East talks\\nPerhaps the most famous international gathering to take place at Camp David happened under President Jimmy Carter. The president brought Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to the site in 1978, forcing two leaders who had little trust for each other to sit down to broker a peace accord named for the retreat.\\nThe touch-and-go negotiations took place over 12 days – all of it in secret.\\nPresident Bill Clinton attempted to recreate the sense of momentum in the Middle East with his own summit in 2000 but Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat failed to reach an agreement.\\nG-8 meeting\\nEisenhower wasn’t the only president to host Russians at Camp David.

Clips shown on Carlson’s Fox News Channel program show Chansley walking freely and peaceably through the building, often accompanied by multiple police officers.\\n“We did not receive that video footage,” Watkins said. “We asked for it, and not just once or twice. Whether we asked for it or not is irrelevant because the government had an absolute, non-compromisible duty to disclose that video and they did not do so.”\\n“And all the while, they were actively representing to the court and the American people that Jake was a leader, leading the charge into the Capitol,” he said. “They did not disclose that footage because it ran contrary to their rote narrative.”\\nWatkins, an attorney for nearly 40 years, told The Daily Wire he was stunned to see the footage, which he could have used to defend Chansley.\\n“I’ve never seen anything so vile as what I’m seeing right now,” he said. “It’s a departure from a pretty high standard they’ve maintained for a long time.

Except that he was smart enough to get it in our faces.”\\n“It’s appalling,” he continued. “Whether you’re right-leaning, you like Tucker Carlson, you hate Tucker Carlson, is irrelevant. This is about putting a dagger in the heart of our justice system. And the person holding the dagger and thrusting it with all its might is our Department of Justice. This required collaboration from the top of the Justice Department right down to the Assistant U.S. Attorney lying to me, a fellow officer of the court, knowing I had a duty to put my client in the best position I could based on the evidence.”\\nChansley in September of 2021 pleaded guilty to unlawfully obstructing an official proceeding. Watkins no longer represents him.\\nKimberly Paschall, the assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia who Watkins said lied, did not immediately return a request for comment. A spokesman for her boss, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Matthew Graves, declined to comment even though Chansley’s case is not ongoing.\\nFederal Judge Royce Lamberth, who presided over the case, should sanction the federal prosecutors, Watkins said.\\n“This is as egregious a violation of the trust as I have seen, with the exception of hiding DNA evidence in a murder case,” he said. “If I’m a federal judge and find out that indeed I was played a fool, I was duped by an assistant U.S. attorney that lied to me repeatedly while Mr. Watkins was yelling that no one was more peaceful than Jacob, and I’m making rulings based on what the government is saying, I’d be one pissed off federal judge.”\\nThose issues should be considered in the many January 6 cases still open, Watkins said. Since Chansley was sentenced more than a year ago, the judge no longer has jurisdiction over the case, he said. The remedy is a “special writ of habeas corpus—it’s an extraordinary remedy but one that’s warranted here.”\\nCourt filings in Chansley’s case corroborate Watkins’ claim that he repeatedly asked for all videos of his client.\\n“Our position is that the government must identify any evidence it believes to capture [defendant], regardless of whether it intends to rely on the same in its case in chief,” one said.\\nIn another discovery request, Watkins wrote that “I am also concerned about the thousands or tens of thousands videos the government has received from public sources, particularly how the government is searching, indexing, and storing these videos, and whether the government is withholding any video footage in its possession; Based on my review of the discovery thus far, there is official video surveillance and publicly sourced video footage that is exculpatory to the defendants. Many of those videos show [defendant] and other[s] peacefully walking around the Capitol. In these videos, they, like thousands of others, are doing nothing illegal with the possible exception of being present in the building, all of which is potentially exculpatory.”\\nPaschall wrote in the case September 17, 2021 that the government was setting up a “global” video dump for all defendants to use. It would be hosted on “evidence.com for voluminous digital media materials (e.g., body-worn-camera footage and U.S. Capitol Police (‘USCP’) surveillance footage),” she wrote. “Further, we will ensure that all Capitol Breach legal defense teams will have access to the same platforms, including technological functionality commensurate to that available to the government, for the purpose of receiving and reviewing discoverable materials.”\\nBut by that time, Chansley had already entered a guilty plea which allowed him to get out of solitary confinement. Even when Watkins looked at the evidence platform–he has represented four January 6 defendants–it did not actually allow lawyers to filter and navigate the videos using the same methods available to law enforcement, he said; it was merely a giant dump of generically presented videos, he said. noting that even now, he has not been able to find the video played by Tucker Carlson using the government’s system. He said the government’s responsibility is to provide evidence pertaining to specific defendants, not a giant dump of all Capitol videos—and that they do have such technology on the government’s side.\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILY WIRE APP\\nIn numerous other January 6 cases, the government has admitted to using facial recognition software to identify which videos show which people. The high-tech methods used to navigate each frame of Capitol video footage were so advanced that it even connected drivers license photos to a system to identify who was in which video.\\n“They have a team of IT people that are able to say this camera is covering this area, we’re doing this for Jake, and they can go from camera to camera, sweep it up and spit it into a government dropbox,” Watkins said.\\nOn February 27, Ryan Nichols, a January 6 defendant who is headed to trial, filed a motion that said Tucker Carlson gained access to 41,000 hours of CCTV footage, “more than double the amount of CCTV footage previously thought to exist. Undersigned Counsel has obtained permission to examine the totality of the abovementioned footage. Importantly, since this newly discovered evidence was made available, we have already learned information directly relevant to Defendant’s case. Defendant’s position is simple and straightforward: there is no justifiable reason why this newly available evidence had not been made available before today.”\\nNichols also moved to remove a protective order that has gagged defense attorneys from sharing video with the public, saying that law enforcement openly appealed to “crowdsourcing” to help identify January 6 suspects, and crowdsourcing is also needed to comb through the footage for exculpatory evidence.\\n“Because it would take a single individual over five years to view 44,000 hours of video, it is impossible for any one Defendant to review this discovery comprehensively,” Nichols’ lawyers wrote.'], 'http://nypost.com/2017/10/13/trump-decertifies-iran-nuke-deal-but-wont-withdraw/': ['nypost.com', 'Trump decertifies Iran nuke deal, but won’t withdraw', 'Social Links For Marisa Schultz, Social Links For Bob Fredericks, Contact The Author', datetime.datetime(2017, 10, 13, 17, 4, 20), 'In a sharp but expected departure from US policy, President Trump said Friday he would decertify the deal on Iran’s nuclear program and kick it back to Congress so lawmakers could make it tougher.\\n“As president of United States, my highest obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people,” the president said, adding that he is determined that “Iran will never get a nuclear weapon.”\\nTrump wants lawmakers to change legislation — known as the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act — that requires the president to certify every 90 days that Iran is in compliance with the 2015 deal.\\nThe president railed against Iran’s “destabilizing influence” in the Middle East, “particularly its support for terrorism and militants.”\\nIran vowed, meanwhile, to retaliate against any action targeting its armed forces, and accused the US of violating the spirit of the nuclear deal.\\n“Iran will strongly respond to any action against its military forces, including the Revolutionary Guards Corps,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said Friday, Reuters reported.\\nHe added that Iran would continue to expand its defensive power — including its ballistic missile program.\\nTrump’s new strategy includes three key goals:\\nRework the deal to make it harder for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.\\nEnsure that it addresses the Islamic theocracy’s ballistic missile program to lessen the threat of attacks on Israel and other nations.\\nCounter Iranian support for terrorists and other bad actors in the region who the White House says contribute to Mideast instability.\\nThe complicated move puts the Trump administration on a political and diplomatic tightrope.\\nThe US will technically remain in the pact even though Trump’s repeatedly slammed it as “embarrassing” and the “worst deal ever.”\\nBut by refusing to certify the merits of the deal, he’s putting its fate on lawmakers’ shoulders and asking them to deliver something the GOP-led Congress has failed to give him — a major piece of legislation.\\nBut Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was wary about the prospects of a new accord.\\n“What we are laying out here is this is the pathway we think provides us the best platform from which to attempt to fix this deal.

We live in a nation governed by the rule of law, not mob violence incited by presidents who cannot accept their own electoral defeat.”\\nThe House voted Jan. 13 to impeach Mr. Trump on a charge of inciting the riot, when some of his supporters tried to stop Congress from certifying Mr. Biden’s win in the Electoral College.\\nAs with Mr. Trump’s first trial in February 2020, his acquittal in the Senate is virtually guaranteed. Democrats would need 17 Republicans to join them to reach the two-thirds majority vote that the Constitution requires for conviction.\\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said Mr. Biden will be too busy this week to spend “too much time watching the proceedings.” Mr. Biden again Monday took a hands-off approach to the impeachment.\\n“He got an offer to come and testify. He decided not to,” Mr. Biden said of his predecessor. “Let the Senate work that out.”\\nSenate leaders in both parties agreed Monday that the trial will begin Tuesday with a debate and a vote on whether it is constitutional to put a former president on trial. A simple majority vote will allow the trial to be held. In a similar test vote on Jan. 26, senators voted 55-45 in favor of a trial, with five Republicans joining all 50 Democrats.\\n“The structure we have agreed to is eminently fair,” Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, said Monday. “Following the despicable attack on Jan. 6, there must be truth and accountability, if we are going to move forward, heal and bring our country together once again. Sweeping something as momentous as this under the rug brings no healing whatsoever.”\\nHe said there must be consequences for a president “who trashes our democracy on his way out the door.”\\nThe former president’s attorneys said they are pleased that the rules for the trial give them “an opportunity to explain to senators why it is absurd and unconstitutional to hold an impeachment trial against a private citizen.”\\nMr. McConnell said the agreement “preserves due process and the rights of both sides.”\\nThe trial will begin at noon Wednesday. Senators will hear arguments over a charge that Mr. Trump incited the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol in which five people died. The House impeachment managers and Mr. Trump’s attorneys each will have up to 16 hours for their presentations.\\nThe impeachment managers, led by Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, could call witnesses if a majority of the Senate approves under an agreement reached by Mr. Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the impeachment managers and Mr. Trump’s attorneys.\\nMr. Trump is not expected to appear in person, although the impeachment managers plan to show video of his speech near the White House before the riot began. The president had urged supporters on social media to come to Washington on Jan. 6 and promised it would be “wild.”\\n“President Trump’s repeated claims about a ‘rigged’ and ‘stolen’ election were false, no matter how many contortions his lawyers undertake to avoid saying so,” the impeachment managers said. “When President Trump demanded that the armed, angry crowd at his Save America Rally ‘fight like hell’ or ‘you are not going to have a country any more,’ he wasn’t urging them to form political action committees” about election integrity.\\nThe former president’s attorneys said Democrats are not interested in pursuing justice because the trial is against someone who is no longer in office.\\n“This was only ever a selfish attempt by Democratic leadership in the House to prey upon the feelings of horror and confusion that fell upon all Americans across the entire political spectrum upon seeing the destruction at the Capitol on Jan. 6 by a few hundred people,” they said. “Instead of acting to heal the nation, or at the very least focusing on prosecuting the lawbreakers who stormed the Capitol, the Speaker of the House and her allies have tried to callously harness the chaos of the moment for their own political gain.”\\nMr. Trump’s attorneys said the rioters “who criminally breached the Capitol did so of their own accord and for their own reasons, and they are being criminally prosecuted.” They said Mr. Trump’s speech that day to thousands of supporters near the White House did not spark the insurrection and that his calls for them to “fight” were meant only figuratively.\\n“A simple timeline of events demonstrates conclusively that the riots were not inspired by the president’s speech at the Ellipse,” they said.\\nMr. Trump’s legal team rejected the argument by House impeachment managers that the president failed to act quickly to quell the violence by some of his supporters on Jan. 6.\\n“Upon hearing of the reports of violence, he tweeted, pleading with the crowd to be ‘peaceful,’ followed by a tweeted video urging people to ‘go home’ and to do so in ‘peace,’” the attorneys wrote. “He and the White House further took immediate steps to coordinate with authorities to provide whatever was necessary to counteract the rioters. There was a flurry of activity inside the White House working to mobilize assets. There is no legitimate proof, nor can there ever be, that President Trump was ‘delighted’ by the events at the capital. He, like the rest of the country, was horrified at the violence.”\\nOn the question of banning Mr. Trump from holding office again, Mr. Trump’s attorneys said Democrats are heading down a “slippery slope” that could be used against Mr. Biden or Mrs. Clinton.\\n“Were it otherwise, a future House could impeach former Vice President Biden for his obstruction of justice in setting up the Russia hoax circa 2016,” said Mr. Trump’s attorneys, suggesting Mr. Biden’s involvement in the investigation of election interference. “While he could not be removed from the vice presidency because his term ended in 2017, he could be barred from holding future office. The same flawed logic the House Managers advance could apply to former Secretary of State Clinton for her violations of 18 U.S.C § 793 [the federal statute on gathering, transmitting or losing defense information]. Impeachment cannot and should not be allowed to devolve into a political weapon.”\\nIn Mrs. Clinton’s case, it was a reference to the private email server she used while in office and thousands of missing or deleted emails.\\nThe Trump team also said voters hold “the ultimate political check” on a candidate for office.\\n“It is almost laughable that the House Managers, who spent four years pretending that Mr. Trump was completely ineffective and illegitimate, are now so worried that he might win again that they seek to illegally impair him,” the Trump attorneys wrote.\\nThe impeachment managers said the case against Mr. Trump is overwhelming.\\n“He has no valid excuse or defense for his actions,” they said. “As charged in the Article of Impeachment, President Trump violated his Oath of Office and betrayed the American people. His incitement of insurrection against the United States government — which disrupted the peaceful transfer of power — is the most grievous constitutional crime ever committed by a president.

Here’s the nitty-gritty of how we believe each day will work, based on a reading of the Senate rules about how to hold trials, how President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial was run, and our current understanding of the expected schedule.\\nThe ceremonial beginning: Wednesday and Thursday\\nAfter the House voted on sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate, the team of House prosecutors known as impeachment managers walked the charges across the Capitol to the Senate.\\nThe managers will present articles of impeachment — literally by reading them — to a full Senate on Thursday at 12.\\nBy Thursday afternoon, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. will arrive and be sworn in as presider by Senate President Pro Tempore Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa). Then Roberts will swear in the 100 senators who will serve as jurors. Here’s the oath they take:\\nThe senators take over and begin the process of starting the trial, which is, translation: paperwork.\\nAdvertisement\\nDuring the Clinton trial, senators were able to move to change or tweak the rules. Will a Trump ally offer a motion to dismiss the trial at the outset? Will Democrats offer a motion to have witnesses? Or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) could stop all motions he doesn’t want from coming to the floor with a motion to do just that. As long as McConnell has 51 votes, he has the power to shape the Senate trial as he sees fit.\\nDuring the Clinton trial, senators also took this time to vote on comparatively mundane motions to allow video equipment and microphones in the Senate chamber to make it more like a courtroom. Both sides, House Democrats and the White House, also have an opportunity to file briefs to bolster their cases. Any documentation each side gives will be printed out and set on senators’ desks. It could contain key dates for both sides, key testimony from House impeachment investigators and whatever rebuttal the president’s defense team wants to offer. During the Clinton trial, the process of setting up the trial lasted six days, though McConnell is signaling that this time it will last just a few days.\\nThe opening arguments: Tuesday\\nAfter a few days of procedural work, the Senate invites the House managers to come back. This is when the actual trial part of the trial begins and senators assume the role of jury. They surrender their cellphones and aren’t allowed to speak after this point. “So they have to sit there quietly, which in 2020 is a nightmare for any human being,” said constitutional expert Sarah Burns with the Rochester Institute of Technology.\\nAdvertisement\\nThis is where McConnell has said the Senate will vote to start the trial with a resolution that sets up the rules of the trial, including how long it will last and how long everyone has to speak. This will not guarantee witnesses, and it is expected to pass with the support of Republican senators over the Democratic minority.\\nEach side will get a set amount of hours to present its case for or against the president. During the Clinton trial, each side got 24 hours spread out over a few days. “The Senate will now hear you” is what we can expect the chief justice to say when it’s each side’s turn to speak.\\nIt’s not in the rules which side goes first. White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and personal Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow will lead the team arguing for Trump’s side. We don’t yet know exactly what their official argument will be, because the White House declined to participate in the House trial, where it had an opportunity to defend the president and to call its own witnesses.\\nAdvertisement\\nDemocrats will start by laying out the evidence presented against the president. You’ll hear something like what House Democrats argued in the House process as they impeached Trump. Here’s House Judiciary Chairman and impeachment manager Jerrold E. Nadler (D-N.Y.): “It is an impeachable offense for the president to exercise the power of his public office to obtain an improper personal benefit, while ignoring or injuring the national interest.”\\nAfter both sides give their arguments, senators can ask questions in writing for a predetermined amount of time. The rules prevent senators from speaking, probably to avoid grandstanding. They literally jot their questions down on a piece of paper and hand it to the chief justice, who reads each one out loud. If it’s for the president’s team, the defense will answer it. If it’s for the House, Democrats will answer it. During the Clinton trial, senators had 16 hours for questions and managed to fit in more than 100.\\nThe debate over witnesses: A few weeks into the trial\\nSenators will vote on whether to dismiss the trial or whether to keep it going and call witnesses and introduce new evidence.\\nAdvertisement\\nThis will be split up into two votes and will be among the most consequential parts of the trial. That’s because there are Republican senators who could cross party lines and help Democrats subpoena Trump’s top aides, such as former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, to share what they know about Trump’s intentions on Ukraine. The Senate would be introducing new evidence that House Democrats couldn’t get access to because Trump prohibited his current and former aides from cooperating with House impeachment investigators.\\nOther witnesses who Democrats have said they want to call are acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and two White House budget officials involved in freezing Ukraine aid, Robert Blair and Michael Duffey. Here’s what the four could know:\\n1. Mick Mulvaney: He is Trump’s acting chief of staff. Impeachment witnesses have said Mulvaney knew about the leverage Trump wanted to use to apply pressure to Ukraine; Mulvaney even said as much publicly. “[Did Trump] also mention to me, in the past, that the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no question about that. But that’s it. And that’s why we held up the money.” He later said there was no quid pro quo for the Ukraine aid. Now the New York Times has reported he was involved in trying to get the aid frozen starting in June. 2. John Bolton: He was serving as Trump’s national security adviser as Ukraine negotiations were going on during the summer. People who worked directly under Bolton testified that he called Mulvaney’s Ukraine efforts a “drug deal” that he wanted no part in. He has indicated that he knows more than what was said in the impeachment hearings. 3. Robert Blair: He’s the top adviser to Mulvaney. When Mulvaney asked if it was possible to hold up the aid, it was Blair he was talking to. Blair seemed to carry out much of the action. “We need to hold it up,” he told budget officials at one point, the Times reported. Blair, like Mulvaney, may also know more about why Trump wanted the aid held in the first place. The Times reported he was in meetings with Trump when Trump expressed skepticism of Ukraine. 4. Michael Duffey: He’s a top White House budget official. A new email shows he told the Defense Department that Trump wanted it to stop the process of giving the money to Ukraine — and to keep it quiet. This happened less than two hours after Trump’s July call with Ukraine’s president in which Trump asked for political favors. “Clear direction from POTUS to continue to hold,” Duffey wrote in an email obtained by the Just Security blog over the holidays. When the aid freeze was out in the open, other obtained emails show he pinned the blame for the aid freeze on the Defense Department. “You can’t be serious. I’m speechless,” was the Pentagon’s reply.\\nIt will take four Senate Republicans to join all Democrats to get a majority vote and keep the trial going. Or, a majority of senators could vote to end the trial and hold a final vote to acquit or convict the president.\\nAdvertisement\\nIf the Senate votes to allow witnesses, we don’t know exactly how things could work, because senators haven’t yet agreed on how they would do it. Trump’s legal team would also get to call witnesses, and Trump has advocated for calling people tangentially related to the allegations, like the whistleblower or Hunter Biden.\\nThe Clinton impeachment trial required witnesses to first be deposed by lawyers behind closed doors for several days. (The Clinton impeachment also allowed one senator from each side to be present.) So the Senate trial could break for a few days. The Senate would then reconvene and vote on which witnesses, if any, to have testify live. Or they could decide to air videotaped depositions. Or they could make the transcripts of the depositions available to senators.\\nIf there are any debates about whether the Senate is following its own rules, senators can ask the chief justice to chime in. Roberts could even cast the deciding vote in 50-50 split. But the chief justice doesn’t set his own rules.\\nClosing arguments and deliberation\\nAfter both parties present the evidence — or after the Senate votes to end the trial before witnesses, whichever comes first — both sides will present their final arguments, much like closing arguments in a trial.\\nAdvertisement\\nAll of this is being done in the open, but the Senate can vote to deliberate behind closed doors with a simple majority. The Senate went into a closed session to debate the actual articles of impeachment against Clinton, with each senator allowed 15 minutes to address everyone else. That could take several days if each senator takes the entire time. (“I remind all senators that Lincoln gave his Gettysburg Address in less than three minutes, and Kennedy’s inaugural address was slightly over seven minutes,” said Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) before they went to debate.)\\nOnce senators are done debating, they will hold two votes on each article of impeachment. Senators will be voting on whether to convict the president of each article. If he’s convicted of even one, he would be thrown out of office. Or they can vote to acquit, which would allow him to stay in office with his name cleared. Another option: Any senator could introduce a separate resolution to censure the president, as a compromise to avoid voting on impeachment. (That’s what Democrats did during the impeachment trial.) A censure wouldn’t remove the president from office, but “it’s a procedure they can use to show their displeasure without reaching arguably the highest level of constitutional hardball, which is what impeachment is,” Burns said.\\nIt takes a two-thirds majority to kick a president out of office, or 67 votes out of 100 to impeach him. Another, more partisan way to look at that is 20 Republicans will need to vote with all Democrats to convict him.\\nIf the Senate votes to convict Trump, it can take another vote to prevent him from running for office ever again. That would require only a majority, or 51, senators.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe Senate can also vote on whether to allow each senator to place into the official record a statement explaining his or her vote.\\nThe end of the trial: Sometime in February\\nTo close out the trial, there are a couple of procedural motions and closing speeches. One fun one during the Clinton trial: Senators presented then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist with a golden gavel award, a tradition in the Senate going to anyone who presides over the Senate for 100 hours. Rehnquist got a standing ovation. During the Clinton trial, the Republican and Democratic leaders both spoke to thank the other for his cooperation, and they got a standing ovation.\\nBut senators who have grievances about the process can also air them in speeches after the trial. That’s what Senate Democrats did who wanted but never got a vote on a censure resolution against Clinton in lieu of impeachment.\\nGiftOutline Gift Article'], 'https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/islamic-state-spy-who-betrayed-baghdadi-was-motivated-revenge-n1074206': ['nbccom', 'The ISIS spy who betrayed al-Baghdadi was an insider motivated by revenge', \"Https, Media-Cldnry.S-Nbcnews.Com Image Upload Newscms, Richard Engel, Marc Smith, Richard Engel Has Been Nbc News' Chief Foreign Correspondent Since, Marc Smith Is A Foreign Producer For Nbc News, Based In London.\", datetime.datetime(2019, 10, 31, 0, 54), \"NORTHERN SYRIA — The Islamic State militant group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was betrayed by a member of his inner circle who helped lead American troops to his compound in northern Syria.\\nThe commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, Gen. Mazloum Abdi, gave NBC News a detailed account of how he spent months running a spy inside ISIS who followed al-Baghdadi as he moved from one safe house to another, until he was finally trapped in a tunnel beneath one of them.\\nAbdi did not identify the source, but Kurdish intelligence officials described him as an Arab who had many relatives in ISIS.\\nAbdi said the informant’s main motivation was revenge.\\n“I think he was under a lot of pressure from his family,” the general said. “His relatives were subjected to harsh treatment by ISIS and he no longer believed in the future of ISIS. He wanted to take revenge on ISIS and al-Baghdadi himself.”\\nThe spy was in a unique and extremely rare position to exact his revenge.\\n“He was, you could say, a security official,” the general said. “A personal security official for al-Baghdadi himself, in charge of al-Baghdadi’s movements. “\\nPart of the informant's job, Abdi said, was “securing the places” where al-Baghdadi would later hide.\\nThis ISIS spy memorized the locations and layouts of al-Baghdadi’s safe houses and even stole samples of the world’s most wanted terrorist’s blood and clothing for DNA analysis, he said.\\nNone of that was easy.\\n“Al-Baghdadi took his security precautions to the highest level,” Abdi said. “He never used high-tech communications at all. Any place he was in, was in a communications blackout, with exception of those who were directly responsible for his security, and that was a small group of people.”\\nAfter years on the run, al-Baghdadi had a relatively small household.\\n“His direct family, the children, his relatives, his siblings, they are formed a tight ring around him,” Abdi said. The ISIS leader only allowed a small group of outsiders to meet him. One of them was the spy.\\nFighters from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) prepare to withdraw from the Sanjak Saadoun border area near the northern Syrian town of Amuda, on Oct. 27, 2019. Delil Souleiman / AFP - Getty Images\\nAbdi declined to say when or how they first made contact with the ISIS informant, but he said the relationship deepened and expanded dramatically in the last five months. That coincided with al-Baghdadi's move from a hideout in eastern Syria to the Idlib province in western Syria, near the Turkish border.\\n“We confirmed that (al-Baghdadi) had been moved to Idlib in April of this year,” Abdi said.\\nIdlib was an unlikely place for the ISIS leader to hide. The province is largely controlled by other Islamist groups, including one linked to al Qaeda that is often called the Al-Nusra Front. The group has, at times, fought against ISIS. Abdi said al-Baghdadi was hiding among a pocket of supporters, in what was largely unfriendly territory.\\n“The idea that al-Baghdadi was in Idlib was completely unexpected,” Abdi said. “It was a surprise to everyone.”\\nIdlib is a large province with a varied terrain, including hills, canyons, olive groves, and several large towns and cities. Abdi said the spy’s meetings in Idlib were frequent but inconsistent. Kurdish intelligence officials said the spy could not approach the ISIS leader at will, but had to wait to be called for meetings. The face-to-face meetings — ostensibly to talk about security, movements, transportation and setting up future safe houses — would turn out to be critical.\\nTo figure out where exactly al-Baghdadi was holed up in Idlib province, Abdi said the spy had to rely on his senses and memory. Al-Baghdadi’s bodyguards would pick him up in a car, or sometimes a taxi. Most visitors to al-Baghdadi were blindfolded on the journey to the ISIS leader. But the spy was more trusted than most. Al-Baghdadi’s personal guards merely asked him not to look out the car windows.\\n“When they approached the area, they would ask him to lower his seat so he can't look around,” Abdi said. “They asked him to lie down, to lower the seat in the taxi.”\\nBut even with the seatback flat, Abdi says the spy was able to pick up bits of the topography and could tell if he was in a town or in the countryside, among olive groves or open fields.\\nFighters from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) take part in a funeral procession for Kurdish fighters killed during clashes in the northeastern Syrian town of Ras al-Ain, in the town of Qamishli, Syria on Oct. 22, 2019. Muhammad Hamed / Reuters\\nOnce inside al-Baghdadi’s hideouts — and there were several, in close proximity to each other — the spy was able to look around freely, the general said.\\nHe started memorizing the internal spaces and distinguishing structural features that could be seen from above, like a red water tank on a roof.\\nThose details, Abdi said, were fed constantly back to the Kurds and, through them, to American intelligence agencies, enabling U.S. aerial surveillance to pinpoint al-Baghdadi’s final hideout. The descriptions of the compound helped American commandos plan their assault.\\n“He provided information about the house itself, the shape of the house and things to do with the house, the specifications of the house,” Abdi said.\\nIncluding details about the tunnel where al-Baghdadi blew himself up with the U.S. forces chasing after him.\\n“We learned that there was a tunnel in the house,” Abdi said. “We learned how many people in the house, how many guards were in the house. We learned the closest al-Nusra checkpoints near the house. We learned all the security details of the house.”\\nBut before sending in the commandos, Abdi said, U.S. intelligence wanted concrete proof that the source had the access to al-Baghdadi that he claimed.\\nThey wanted to make sure it wasn’t all a hoax, or worse, a trap, Abdi said.\\nSo the spy stole a pair of the ISIS leader’s used underwear and later a blood sample to compare with known samples of al-Baghdadi's DNA. Al-Baghdadi had been in U.S. custody in Iraq years before.\\nAbdi said the spy stole underwear roughly three months ago from a house al-Baghdadi had previously used and abandoned. He wouldn’t say how the blood was collected, only that it was taken about a month ago. Abdi said both DNA tests matched, proving the spy’s bona fides.\\n“After that, the CIA took this more seriously,” Abdi said. “They began to work hard and serious on the highest level.”\\nBut the timetable for launching a raid on al-Baghdadi’s compound was delayed by President Donald Trump’s sudden decision to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria and the subsequent Turkish invasion.\\nSuddenly, Abdi said, his Kurdish-led forces had to focus more of their attention on defending themselves.\\nMeanwhile, al-Baghdadi was preparing to move yet again.\\n“Al al-Baghdadi had prepared a new house for himself in a different place located in the area of Dera al-Fraat (Jarablus area),” Abdi said. “That house was ready. I assume that within 48 hours he would have left the house to the new house, and the new house was completely different and wasn't known.”\\nAbdi said the spy was at the compound when U.S. Special Forces attacked.\\n“He was there and he returned safely with the American forces,” he said.\\nU.S. officials have told The Washington Post he’ll likely receive all or part of the $25 million bounty for al-Baghdadi’s head.\"], 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/11/michael-horowitz-just-shot-down-bunch-trump-conspiracy-theories/': ['washingtonpost.com', 'Michael Horowitz just shot down a bunch of Trump conspiracy theories', 'Aaron Blake, Staff Writer', datetime.datetime(2019, 12, 11, 22, 5, 59), 'Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\\nJustice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz this week issued what is, by any objective standard, a pretty brutal report.

Noting “the presidential change of your country,” he wrote that he wished “to share with you a few realities about the ongoing war in Afghanistan.” In a little under two thousand words, Mujahid laid out his argument: the Taliban could not be defeated by the United States, the war was unnecessary, and the U.S. should go home. “President of America!” he concluded. “Perhaps some contents of this letter will prove bitter for your taste. But since they are realities and tangible facts, they must be accepted and treated as bitter medicine that is taken by patients out of fear of seeing their condition deteriorate.”\\nAs the chaotic initial weeks of Trump’s Administration unfolded, the Taliban appeared to gather hope that the President would decide to withdraw from Afghanistan, as he had once advocated. “So far he has shown no visible interest in this faraway theatre,” an online Taliban post noted in April. “The Trump Administration should embody their people’s spirit and stop supporting a ‘losing horse.’ They should save their blood and tears for a more important day and a more important conflict.”\\nOn Monday night, at Fort Myer, in Arlington, Virginia, Trump delivered a vague but hawkish speech about the Afghanistan war. He pledged commitment to Afghanistan’s people and its government, and he seemed to open the way for American troop increases. The speech disappointed Mujahid. He called Trump’s ideas “old” and “unclear.” In this, he was aligned with Breitbart News, which judged, accurately, that the President had endorsed “tweaks around the edges of the current strategy instead of a different approach.” Breitbart’s home page on Tuesday was replete with headlines criticizing Trump and his national-security team for their Afghanistan announcements—the apparent first salvo in the former White House strategist Steve Bannon’s media campaign against “globalists” in the Administration and elsewhere.\\nThat the Taliban and Bannon agree on something does not necessarily imply that it is wrong. (Taliban publications promote a surprising range of causes; earlier this year, the movement urged its followers to plant trees, to beautify the Earth.) It is certainly true, as the Breitbart writers argue, that Trump has now baldly reversed positions that he took before becoming President. “Afghanistan is a total disaster,” Trump tweeted in 2012. “We don’t know what we are doing.”\\nOn Monday night, Trump explained why he had changed his mind. “My original instinct was to pull out,” he admitted. But, “after many meetings, over many months,” he had “arrived at three fundamental conclusions” about the Afghanistan war. First, the United States “must seek an honorable and enduring outcome worthy of the tremendous sacrifices that have been made, especially the sacrifices of lives.” Second, “the consequences of a rapid exit are both predictable and unacceptable,” meaning that the government in Kabul would soon collapse, creating “a vacuum” for terrorists. Third, the security threats in Afghanistan and the region are “immense.”\\nIn fashioning a new approach, Trump said, “We will learn from history.” He promised that U.S. strategy would now “change dramatically.” But he went on to outline, with little precision, the “pillars” of a policy that, in many cases, was a variation on approaches that George W. Bush and Barack Obama had previously attempted. The modest changes that Trump articulated mainly involved greater deference to the Pentagon. For those who have followed Afghanistan-policy debates since 2001, the speech often sounded as if it had been written at Central Command.\\nOne of the contradictions in U.S. strategy in Afghanistan since about 2006 is that many experts, including military ones, will acknowledge that the war cannot be won on the battlefield, and yet they will simultaneously advocate for policies that prioritize military action. On the front lines, the Afghanistan war has long since devolved into a stalemate between the Taliban, on one side, and the Afghan government and its NATO allies, on the other—a grind that currently claims the lives of a few thousand Afghan civilians annually, plus those of many hundreds more Afghan soldiers and police, not to mention Taliban guerrillas. Many of the American generals whom Trump admires so uncritically know that the war cannot be won by force of arms, even if that fact grates on them. As early as September, 2008, two years before General David Petraeus took command of the Afghanistan war, he was saying publicly that “you don’t kill or capture your way out of an industrial-strength insurgency.” Yet this appears to be the Trump Administration’s preferred line of effort. On Monday, the President declared, “Our troops will fight to win.”\\nApart from scolding Pakistan and praising India, Trump made little mention of the Afghan and regional political complexities that have helped make the war so intractable. It is a little late to get tough on Pakistan, for example; the country’s ruling generals have already reduced their partnership with America and thrown their lot in with China. Beijing is investing billions of dollars in a transport corridor through Pakistan to a port on the Arabian Sea, a strategic route for Chinese imports and exports that eludes the mess in Afghanistan. China might prefer stability, but it seems content to let the United States bear the expense of trying to subdue the Taliban; these days, Beijing has even less reason to coöperate, given the Trump Administration’s hostile attitudes toward China’s trade surpluses and its relations with North Korea. Vladimir Putin’s Russia, for its part, sees in Afghanistan an opportunity to punish American forces in the same quagmire that ensnared the Soviet 40th Army. Meanwhile, Iran is deepening its long-standing influence in the country.\\nNor did Trump thank the NATO governments and other allies of the United States that continue to share the costly burden of shoring up Afghanistan—instead, he said that he would ask them for more money. In July, 2016, at a NATO summit in Warsaw, member states agreed to fund the Afghan Army and police through 2020. Three months later, at a conference in Brussels, international donors pledged fifteen billion dollars in financial aid over the same period. The commitments were intended to signal resilient international support for the Kabul government led by President Ashraf Ghani, a graduate of Columbia University and a former World Bank technocrat. Ghani was elected in 2014, in a disputed vote marred by allegations of fraud. After negotiations overseen by then Secretary of State John Kerry, Ghani agreed to share power with a rival, Abdullah Abdullah, who assumed the strange title of Chief Executive of Afghanistan. Ongoing tension between the two men over prerogatives and patronage has paralyzed the government and undermined the war. A recent study by the International Crisis Group found that “political partisanship has permeated every level of the security apparatus, undermining the command structures” of the Army and police, and that the unity government “has yet to tackle the corruption, nepotism and factionalism within it. These weaknesses have played a major role in allowing Taliban advances countrywide.”\\nThe Warsaw and Brussels pledges, complemented by American military aid, were meant to buy time, in the hope that, somehow, the problems of weak governance and ethnic polarization would resolve themselves. This now looks unlikely: Afghanistan faces fresh Presidential elections in 2019, according to the constitution, but the paper bargain between Ghani and Abdullah, which contemplated parliamentary and local elections by now, is stalled, and the potential for the kind of fraud that bedevilled the two previous Presidential votes has not been addressed.\\nThis shoring-up effort was the “globalist” policy toward Afghanistan—or, in another way of thinking, the policy of American leadership carried out through international alliances, which President Trump inherited and which he has now endorsed, more or less. In its aims, the policy has merit: it defends Afghanistan’s urban, young, modernizing population; it supports an Afghan government that, regardless of its many problems, has been willing to take responsibility for the war against the Taliban, despite very high casualties; and it constrains regional terrorist groups. The problem lies not with the policy’s goals but with its means. Only very active regional diplomacy and negotiation among the regional and great powers involved in the Afghanistan conflict has even a small chance of reducing the violence and stabilizing the country, perhaps by eventually encouraging the Taliban to lay down its arms and join Afghan politics. Yet Trump, in his speech, mentioned diplomacy only in passing.\\nIn a separate statement, however, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson largely echoed the policies of the Bush and Obama Administrations. He praised India’s role in the region and acknowledged that Pakistan has been a victim as well as an incubator of terrorism. Notably, in light of Trump’s bellicosity, Tillerson offered the Taliban the prospect of “a path to peace and political legitimacy through a negotiated political settlement to end the war”—a path that the Obama Administration tried and failed to navigate. Trump, in his remarks, cast doubt on such a negotiation.\\n“It seems America is not yet ready to end the longest war in its history,” Zabihullah Mujahid noted on Tuesday. Indeed, the battle lines with the Taliban are again drawn; there does not appear to be a fresh idea on either side of the war, apart from tree planting. The likely result, to adapt Trump’s language, is both predictable and unacceptable.'], 'https://spectator.org/a-super-speech/': ['spectator', 'Trump’s Blast Off', 'Ben Stein, George Neumayr, Wesley J.

He should understand that his words in the past have been followed by acts of violence by some supporters — ranging from incidents at his campaign rallies to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\\nDean Obeidallah\\nThat is why it’s deeply alarming that on Saturday, Trump called on his supporters to “Protest, take our nation back” if the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, charges him with crimes. In the post on his social media site, Truth Social, Trump said he expected to be arrested Tuesday, although his team said afterward it had not received any notification from prosecutors.\\nLater Saturday, in a follow-up on Truth Social, Trump repeated the message in all caps, writing, “THEY’RE KILLING OUR NATION AS WE SIT BACK & WATCH. WE MUST SAVE AMERICA! PROTEST, PROTEST, PROTEST!!!”\\nTrump’s latest call for protests instantly conjures up his infamous December 19, 2020, tweet alleging election fraud and announcing, “Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” adding, “Be there, will be wild!” As federal prosecutors and the January 6 House committee that investigated the attack have laid out, some Trump supporters saw that tweet as a call to arms.\\nKelly Meggs, a leader of the Florida chapter of the paramilitary group the Oath Keepers, is just one example. Referencing Trump’s “wild” tweet, Meggs wrote in a Facebook message in late December 2020, “Trump said It’s gonna be wild!!!!!!! It’s gonna be wild!!!!!!! He wants us to make it WILD that’s what he’s saying. He called us all to the Capitol and wants us to make it wild!!! Sir Yes Sir!!! Gentlemen we are heading to DC pack your s***!!”\\nMeggs has since been convicted — along with Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes — of seditious conspiracy for roles in the January 6 attack.\\nIt isn’t the first time Trump has called for protests if he is charged with a crime. The former president began priming his base back in January 2022 when he told supporters to take to the streets if any prosecutor, anywhere, charges him — not just the Manhattan district attorney. At a campaign-style rally in Texas, Trump said: “If these radical, vicious, racist prosecutors do anything wrong or illegal, I hope we are going to have in this country the biggest protests we have ever had in Washington, DC, in New York, in Atlanta and elsewhere.”\\nBefore the January 6 attack, Trump’s call for “protests” could be seen as an attempt to feed his ego by urging supporters to attend his rallies. In a post-January 6 America, however, it could be viewed as a potential attempt to replicate the insurrection. But this time, the desperate Trump wants his supporters to protect him from being held accountable for potential crimes.\\nThis scenario seems to have played out after the FBI’s August 8 search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in the investigation of handling classified documents following a court-approved warrant. Trump released a statement shortly afterward that read in part, “These are dark times for our Nation, as my beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents,” slamming what he called the “political persecution.” Two days later he baselessly accused the FBI of potentially planting evidence.\\nIt is not surprising that the FBI was soon subject to an “unprecedented” number of threats against bureau personnel and property. One person — who had in the past repeated the false 2020 election claims on Trump’s social media platform — tried to breach an FBI field office in Cincinnati and was killed in a shootout with police.\\nThe former president also has repeatedly floated pardoning the January 6 attackers should he be reelected — even claiming they deserve an “apology.” Trump’s message is clear: I will have your back if I can get back in the White House.\\nIt’s reassuring to see that Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, told his staff by email Saturday night, “We do not tolerate attempts to intimidate our office or threaten the rule of law in New York.” While not mentioning Trump by name, he added, “Our law enforcement partners will ensure that any specific or credible threats against the office will be fully investigated and that the proper safeguards are in place so all 1,600 of us have a secure work environment.”\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.

The continuing resolution that is to run for three weeks, as signed by the president, does not include a dime of funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. The Mexican standoff over the Mexican border wall did, however, accomplish something important. It revealed just how radical the Democrats have become on the issue of immigration. In the run-up to the 2020 election elections, they have been smoked out. That’s not nothing.\\nThe telling fact, what will become clear over the next two years, was Democratic radicalism that caused the shutdown in the first place. President Trump did not ask for much, just $5.7 billion to begin construction of a barrier along porous sections of the border. The sum of $5.7 billion seems like a lot to mere mortals, but it was no more than a rounding error against the largesse of the federal budget. Not long ago, Democrats like Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton, happily voted to build barriers along the border. The president’s request can only be judged unreasonable by a campaign consultant looking for an issue to exploit.\\nBut something happened on the way to striking a budget deal. When faced with President Trump’s demand for an appropriation for wall construction, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, the party theologian, said building the wall would be an “immorality.” The Democrats, figuring that being against borders and national sovereignty, the building blocks of the nation state, would be winning politics, boasted they would never spend a penny on maintaining the border. This was breathtakingly radical, and led directly to the shutdown when the president rightly declined to go along.\\nThe shutdown did inflict damage. Eight hundred thousand federal workers went weeks without pay, though they will be paid for time missed. Less fortunate contract workers, like those who clean the restrooms at the Smithsonian Institution, for example, won’t be. During the shutdown, air traffic control and the TSA were hobbled. National parks were closed. Tax rebate checks will be delayed, given the backlog of work that piled up during the shutdown.\\nIt’s clear to everyone why the president felt compelled to end the shutdown, even at the cost of nothing for the wall. In the face of Democratic intransigence, he took the responsible position. He couldn’t negotiate a compromise with Democrats who said they would never compromise.\\nThere are two reasons, neither good. The first is nakedly political. The central promise of Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign was building the wall. Denying him the ability to do that would damage his re-election campaign by making the wall a broken promise. The president’s own political miscalculation played a part here. He should have asked for funding for the wall when the Republicans controlled the House instead of waiting until Mrs. Pelosi took over.\\nThe other reason is even more cynical. Democrats claim to oppose the wall because “it doesn’t work.” This is nonsense. The experience of San Diego, Israel and other places demonstrates that walls work well. If walls are not effective, why are they, as Mrs. Pelosi insists, “immoral?” In fact, the actual reason Democrats oppose the border barrier is precisely because walls do work. With declining support from white and older Americans, the Democrats have concluded that their future lies in importing a new electorate from south of the border. A wall would prevent that.\\nThe continuing resolution runs until Feb. 15, when there could very well be another shutdown. The Democrats are unlikely to capitulate. Neither is the president. Mr. Trump has floated another idea to get his wall funding, declaring a national emergency and order the wall to be built. The president has the legal authority to do so, though this option makes a lot of us uneasy. Declaring a national emergency in the face of political intransigence would set a dangerous precedent. The Democrats, by refusing to protect the country’s sovereignty for nakedly political ends, are setting a dangerous precedent themselves.'], 'https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/01/the-insurrection-at-the-capitol-challenged-the-way-newsrooms-frame-unrest/': ['niemanlab', 'The insurrection at the Capitol challenged the way newsrooms frame unrest', 'Danielle Brown, Joshua Benton, Laura Hazard Owen, Thomas E. Patterson, Dan Gillmor, Jan.', datetime.datetime(2021, 1, 8, 10, 0), 'The chaos at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday wasn’t typical. Nor was the coverage.\\nFootage carried live by cable news and clips and photos shared across social media were jolting. One image showed a man who had broken into the building sitting in a chair, foot on desk, in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office. A video clip showed a crowd chasing a police officer as he retreated up the stairs.\\nAs a researcher of media and social movements , I was absorbed by the violent events that unfolded. My research on protests shows that how the media portrays unrest — as riot or resistance, for example — helps shape the public’s view of the protest’s aims. Typically news coverage pays more attention to disruptive tactics than to the aims of protesters, especially when it comes to anti-Black racism protests or action that radically challenges the status quo.\\nBy focusing on the disruption while underreporting the protest’s substance, agendas and goals, coverage contributes to a “hierarchy of social struggle” in which the voices of some advocacy groups are lifted over others.\\nBut this was different. News audiences aren’t necessarily used to seeing violence and disruption at citizen demonstrations in support of a president — and certainly not on the scale we witnessed on Wednesday at the Capitol. It proved a novel test of how the news media would frame the unrest and the aims of those involved.\\nRiot or resistance?\\nTraditional news media have come under heavy criticism for their coverage of civil rights protests , most recently after the death of George Floyd. A study of demonstrations between 1967 and 2007 concluded that protests were often framed as public nuisances, especially when those doing the protesting were ideologically liberal. Conservative protests were less likely to be seen as nuisances. And my research has highlighted the tendency to frame anti-Black racism protests as “riots” more than other protests.\\nBut much of the coverage of events at the Capitol stripped euphemistic labels like “protests,” “rallies” and “demonstrations” from their description of what was going on.\\nInstead, news media labeled the event as a “siege” or “insurrection” carried out by a “mob.”\\nIt is also notable that at least one major network, CNN, described the events as “terrorism” — a term still more common in descriptions of Muslims and people of color than white supremacists.\\nNo tanks necessary?\\nIn my work, I call for journalists to balance their attention to protester actions with the reasons and grievances that brought the demonstrator out onto the streets in the first place — and reflect this in their reporting. This balance usually skews toward the actions, especially when those actions involve violence or damage to property or when there are confrontations with police.\\nDespite the escalation of events from protest to insurrection, the initial coverage Wednesday seemed to include the grievances of those taking part.\\nCoverage also focused on police behavior, but it appeared more concerned with the lack of policing. Police didn’t show up in riot gear or wielding batons as Trump supporters ascended the Capitol steps. There were no tanks, or large-caliber rifles on display as protesters arrived.\\nThis too was different from other protests. Many have commented on social media that if these had been Black Lives Matter protesters, there might have been a very different outcome — the assumption being Trump-sponsored insurrections are treated differently by authorities.\\nSome news media outlets, such as USAToday, made this comparative difference clear in their reporting. This is not a typical narrative in mainstream protest news coverage.\\nEven the initial news coverage by Fox News seemed largely in line with the framing of other news channels, until the evening, when commentary from the “Tucker Carlson Tonight” show shifted the network’s narrative.\\nCarlson’s monologue on Wednesday evening half-addressed the siege, but asked the audience to consider why people like Ashli Babbitt, the woman shot and killed during the break-in, attended the rally in the first place. Detailing her tragic death, Tucker said, “She bore no resemblance to the angry children we have seen wrecking our cities in recent months.” Carlson used this to transition to his critique of liberal leaders and the election results.\\nSome may dismiss Carlson’s comments as irrelevant and radical. However, his framing provides insight about how the right-wing media has sought to portray certain protests in recent years, and the consequences of that action.\\nMy colleague from Michigan State University Rachel Mourão and I have used panel survey data from 2015 and 2016 to explore attitudes about protests in general and Black Lives Matter’s core grievances specifically. The results showed that increased consumption of news from right-wing organizations like Fox and Breitbart didn’t really affect people’s views about protests generally. But it did strongly correlate with more negative opinions about some of the core grievances and demands connected with Black Lives Matter.\\nWake-up call\\nMore evidence lies in other popular right-wing media. Their framing doesn’t accentuate the unrest’s violent actions carried out by an angry mob at all.\\nLess than 24 hours after the siege, the homepage of right-wing outlet One America News Network’s (OAN) website was devoid of any pictures of protests. Meanwhile, Breitbart had a Mark Zuckerberg image front and center. That article described how Facebook had “blacklisted” Trump after the “events” on Capitol Hill.\\nRight-wing media not only distort the realities of the insurrection, they undermine and erase the impact of such undemocratic actions. Out of sight, out of mind.\\nThese are starkly different realities from the websites of news outlets such as ABC, NBC, CBS and CNN, as well as newspaper front pages — both online and in print — from around the country.\\nIn recent months, some news organizations have vowed to address shortcomings in their coverage, including how reporters cover protests. If the unrest that followed the police killing of George Floyd was the event that triggered a welcomed media reckoning, then the insurrection at the Capitol could be the event that helps outlets better understand why framing is important.\\nDanielle Kilgo is the John and Elizabeth Bates Cowles Professor of Journalism, Diversity, and Equality at the University of Minnesota.

Restrictions are certainly tighter than in the United States.\\nHowever, individual weapons are not registered, meaning police have little oversight over how many guns people hold.\\nArdern said a further tranche of reforms will cover the firearm registry and licensing.\\nJohn Hart, a farm owner and former Green Party candidate, surrendered his semi-automatic rifle to police after the shooting, one of 37 weapons police said had been voluntarily returned ahead of the new laws.\\n“The time is right.

The decision allowed him to curry enough favor with the former president that Trump would later whip votes for McCarthy during the House leadership vote, allowing the California Republican to become speaker.\\nSince long before he took over the speaker\\'s gavel, McCarthy identified MAGA extremists, including Rep.

The tax plan, though meager in detail, matched up closely with the promises he made during his victorious 2016 election campaign.\\nInvestors, who had been awaiting tax-plan details for months, largely shrugged off the news, with many saying it was still short on specifics and faced a long road to enactment. “Wake me up when something actually gets signed into law,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com in West Palm Beach, Florida.\\nOnly Congress can make major tax law changes, and Democrats immediately attacked the Republican president’s plan as fiscally irresponsible.\\n“President Trump’s tax plan is short on details and long on giveaways to big corporations and billionaires,” said Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House of Representatives.\\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the top Republicans on the congressional tax-writing committees welcomed the Trump proposals, while leaving space for details to change as legislation evolves.\\n“The principles outlined by the Trump administration today will serve as critical guideposts” as Congress and the administration work on tax changes, they said in a statement.\\nU.S. stocks pared gains on Wednesday after the plan was unveiled. While Wall Street has been optimistic about the prospect of corporate tax cuts since Trump’s election in November, the stocks rally has stalled lately because of a lack of clarity about Trump’s policies and concern over his failure to push through a healthcare bill.\\nThe benchmark Dow Jones industrial average of blue-chip stocks .DJI on Wednesday closed down one-tenth of 1 percent.\\nSome analysts said investors were aware of the long road ahead before any tax bill is passed.\\n“We have a pretty good idea that he (Trump) is targeting lower corporate taxes, lower individual taxes and a simplification of the process, but all that is in an ideal world,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey.\\nBUSINESS TAX RATE CUTS\\nIn the plan, unveiled at the White House by Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Trump proposed cutting to 15 percent both the income tax rate paid by public corporations and that paid by “pass-through” businesses, including partnerships, S corporations and sole proprietorships.\\nThe top corporate rate is now 35 percent, though few multinational companies pay it, thanks to loopholes that allow them to lower their effective tax rates. Despite this, corporations have pushed for a tax rate cut for many years, and Trump has obliged.\\nThe top rate for pass-throughs, which account for most small businesses, is 39.6 percent, the same top rate paid by individuals. Unlike corporations, the profits of “pass-through” businesses flow directly onto their owners’ tax returns.\\nIn another concession to long-standing demands from corporate America, Trump called for bringing corporate profits being held offshore by multinationals into the country at a rate well below the current 35 percent rate now owed on “repatriated” earnings. He did not say what that rate would be, but said the administration was working with Congress on a low rate.\\nSlideshow ( 14 images )\\nAbout $2.6 trillion in profits are being held tax-exempt abroad by U.S. multinationals under a rule that says they are only taxable if brought into the United States.\\nIf enacted, the repatriation tax holiday would produce a one-time surge in government revenue. If it were dedicated to infrastructure spending, it could attract votes from Democrats.\\nThe plan also urged adoption of a “territorial” corporate tax system that would largely exempt foreign profits of U.S.-based corporations from federal taxation.\\nRyan expressed optimism about Trump’s plan, even though it excluded a “border adjustment” tax on imports he has promoted. That idea was part of initiatives floated by House Republicans as a way to offset revenue losses resulting from steep tax cuts.\\nSlideshow ( 14 images )\\nSTATE, LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION TARGETED\\nFor average U.S. taxpayers, Trump proposed help by doubling the standard deductions for individuals who do not itemize; simplifying tax returns by reducing the number of tax brackets to three from seven; and providing unspecified tax relief for families with child and dependent care expenses.\\nHe also called for repealing inheritance taxes on estates and the alternative minimum tax, both measures that would help a handful of wealthy taxpayers.\\nTrump’s laundry list of tax cuts would reduce revenues for the U.S. government, which is already running a deficit and deeply in debt. He offered few proposals to offset those losses.\\nDemocrats and fiscal-hawk Republicans will be concerned about how much Trump’s proposals would expand the deficit. To minimize that, Republicans will rely heavily on “dynamic scoring,” an economic modeling method that attempts to predict economic growth and new tax revenues resulting from tax cuts.\\nMnuchin said the revenue losses would also be offset by killing many tax loopholes. He said at a briefing that Trump’s plan would kill most tax deductions, except those for charitable giving, retirement savings and mortgage interest.\\nCohn said at the briefing that one deduction on Trump’s chopping block is for state and local tax payments, which is estimated to cost the U.S. Treasury $96 billion this year. Ending it would raise about that much in revenue.\\nSuch a move would hurt high-tax states, which tend to vote Democratic, such as New York and California, where the state and local tax deduction is a major item, said some tax analysts.\\nLike all of Trump’s proposals, this one would face intense scrutiny in Congress.\\nThe No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, Dick Durbin, attacked the tax proposal and the fact Trump, a wealthy New York real estate developer, had declined to make public his personal tax returns.\\n“President Trump should release his own tax returns if he wants to have any credibility in a debate about America’s tax code,” Durbin said.

Preparations to conduct such an operation began weeks ago, but in planning the date and time, the FBI Miami Field Office and Washington headquarters were focused on the former president\\'s scheduled return to Florida from his residences in New York and New Jersey.\\n\"They were seeking to avoid any media circus,\" says the second source, a senior intelligence official who was briefed on the investigation and the operation. \"So even though everything made sense bureaucratically and the FBI feared that the documents might be destroyed, they also created the very firestorm they sought to avoid, in ignoring the fallout.\"\\nA \"Florida For Trump\" flag being displayed outside Mar-a-Lago following the FBI search. Eva Marie Uzcategui/GETTY\\nOn Monday at about 9 a.m. EDT, two dozen FBI agents and technicians showed up at Donald Trump\\'s Florida home to execute a search warrant to obtain any government-owned documents that might be in the possession of Trump but are required to be delivered to the Archives under the provisions of the 1978 Presidential Records Act. (In response to the Hillary Clinton email scandal, Trump himself signed a law in 2018 that made it a felony to remove and retain classified documents.)\\nThe act establishes that presidential records are the property of the U.S. government and not a president\\'s private property. Put in place after Watergate to avoid the abuses of the Nixon administration, the law imposes strict penalties for failure to comply. \"Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined\" $2,000, up to three years in prison or \"shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.\"\\nThe act, and concerns about the illegal possession of classified \"national defense information\" are the basis for the search warrant, according to the two sources. The raid had nothing to do with the January 6 investigation or any other alleged wrongdoing by the former president.\\nThe road to the raid began a year-and-a-half ago, when in the transition from the Trump administration to that of President Joe Biden, there were immediate questions raised by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) as to whether the presidential records turned over to the federal agency for historical preservation were complete or not.\\nIn February, Archivist David Ferriero testified before Congress that his agency began talking with Trump\\'s people right after they left office and that the Trump camp had already returned 15 boxes of documents to the Archives. Ferriero said that in those materials, the Archives discovered items \"marked as classified national security information,\" unleashing further inquiries as to whether Trump continued to possess classified material.\\nRead more Will Trump Do Time? What It Would Take to Convict the Former President Will Trump Do Time? What It Would Take to Convict the Former President\\nThe basic outlines of the facts surrounding this timeline have been confirmed by the former president. He has previously said that he was returning any official records to the Archives, labeling any confusion in the matter as \"an ordinary and routine process to ensure the preservation of my legacy and in accordance with the Presidential Records Act.\" He also claimed the Archives \"did not \\'find\\' anything\" in what he had already been returned, suggesting that there was nothing sensitive. He said the documents had inadvertently shipped to Florida during the six-hour transition period in which his belongings were moved.\\nAccording to the Justice Department source, the Archives saw things differently, believing that the former White House was stonewalling and continued to possess unauthorized material. Earlier this year, they asked the Justice Department to investigate.\\nIn late April, the source says, a federal grand jury began deliberating whether there was a violation of the Presidential Records Act or whether President Trump unlawfully possessed national security information. Through the grand jury process, the National Archives provided federal prosecutors with copies of the documents received from former President Trump in January 2022. The grand jury concluded that there had been a violation of the law, according to the Justice Department source.\\nIn the past week, the prosecutor in the case and local Assistant U.S. Attorney went to Florida magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart in West Palm Beach to seek approval for the search of Donald Trump\\'s private residence. The affidavit to obtain the search warrant, the intelligence source says, contained abundant and persuasive detail that Trump continued to possess the relevant records in violation of federal law, and that investigators had sufficient information to prove that those records were located at Mar-a-Lago—including the detail that they were contained in a specific safe in a specific room.\\n\"In order for the investigators to convince the Florida judge to approve such an unprecedented raid, the information had to be solid, which the FBI claimed,\" says the intelligence source.\\nRead more Will GOP Fury Over Trump-FBI Battle Blunt Democrats\\' Post-Roe Midterm Edge? Will GOP Fury Over Trump-FBI Battle Blunt Democrats\\' Post-Roe Midterm Edge?\\nAccording to experts familiar with FBI practices, Judge Reinhart reviewed the prosecutor\\'s evidence and asked numerous questions about the sources and the urgency. The judge signed a search warrant allowing the FBI to look for relevant material and the FBI then planned the operation, wanting to conduct the raid while Trump was spending time at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. A Secret Service source who spoke on background said the Secret Service director was given advance warning and was later told the specifics of the raid.\\nBecause the Secret Service is still responsible for protecting the former president, his family, and his property, the FBI had to coordinate with the Secret Service to gain access to the grounds.\\nA convoy of unmarked black SUVs and a Ryder rental truck filled with about three dozen FBI special agents and technicians entered the gates in the early evening. Heavily armed Secret Service agents were also visibly present at the gates. The Palm Beach Police Department was also present at the scene.\\nThe entire operation, which concluded about 7 p.m., was conducted relatively stealthily. No FBI people were seen in their iconic blue windbreakers announcing the presence of the Bureau. And though local law enforcement was present, the Palm Beach Police Department was careful to tweet on Tuesday that it \"was not aware of the existence of a search warrant nor did our department assist the FBI in the execution of a search warrant.\"\\nAccording to news reports, some 10-15 boxes of documents were removed from the premises. Donald Trump said in a statement that the FBI opened his personal safe as part of their search. Trump attorney Lindsey Halligan, who was present during the multi-hour search, says that the FBI targeted three rooms—a bedroom, an office and a storage room. That suggests that the FBI knew specifically where to look.\\n\"This unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate,\" former President Trump said in a statement. He called the raid \"prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don\\'t want me to run for President in 2024.\"\\nThough Trump and his Republican Party allies are portraying the raid as politically motivated, it is likely the unprecedented nature of the raid on the property of a former president will have the greatest reverberation. Even Trump\\'s political rivals have rallied in condemning the FBI.\\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence tweeted that \"no former President of the United States has ever been subject to a raid of their personal residence in American history.\" Mike Pompeo, Trump\\'s Secretary of State and CIA director, tweeted that Attorney General Merrick Garland \"must explain why 250 yrs of practice was upended w/ this raid. I served on Benghazi Com[mittee] where we proved Hillary possessed classified info. We didn\\'t raid her home.\"\\nThe Biden White House says the president was not briefed about the Mar-a-Lago raid and knew nothing about it in advance. \"The Justice Department conducts investigations independently and we leave any law enforcement matters to them,\" Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday afternoon. \"It would not be appropriate for us to comment on any ongoing investigations.\"\\nAs U.S. President Joe Biden, appearing via teleconference, looks on, Attorney General Merrick Garland attends a meeting of the Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access during an event at the White House complex August 3, 2022 in Washington, DC.

He didn\\'t deliver one. Advantage, Hillary. Some thoughts:\\n(1) At the risk of being accused of homerism (disclosure: I\\'m a Fox News contributor), Chris Wallace was superb in his moderating duties last night. He eschewed the temptation to come barging out of the gate with questions about salacious news cycle-driven dramas, opting to save \"fitness to be president\" themes for much later in the evening. He led with issues. This was a debate that primarily focused on issues. The Fox News Sunday host held each candidate to account for the proposals they\\'ve put forward, and the things they\\'ve said. He pressed Trump for specifics. He challenged Clinton with honed evidence. He was tough on both of them, directed the (sometimes wild) rhetorical traffic with laudable poise, and afforded the candidates a fairly wide berth to engage each other, but without allowing the exchanges to spin out of control. A-plus work. And I\\'d be saying the same thing if he worked for another network.\\n(2) Hillary Clinton began the night with a breathtaking mischaracterization of the Supreme Court\\'s Heller decision on guns, and whitewashing her extreme stance on abortion as if it were perfectly normal -- as opposed to radically out of step with most voters. Alas, because Trump was under-prepared to correct and clarify on both issues, most viewers probably thought she \"won\" that segment. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court is the top reason for conservatives to oppose her. On immigration, she complained that her Wikileaks-provided \"open borders\" speech excerpt was taken out of context. The problem? She\\'s withheld the transcripts of her Wall Street addresses, which makes her dings on Trump\\'s hidden tax returns less impactful. She much preferred talk about Russian meddling in the election to the content of the leaks -- and Trump probably helped her by refusing to accept Russian guilt as a fact, which our intelligence says it is. As a result, her slams on him for being a Russian puppet had some bite. Her economic answers were dull, predictable, and full of lefty tropes and poll-tested buzz phrases. She pressed her toughest case against Trump\\'s temperament, drawing some blood throughout that extended back-and-forth, I suspect. Her \"horrifying\" denunciation of his refusal to pledge to accept the election results (more on that later) was a memorable moment that will get a lot of play, and her rundown of all the times Trump has screamed \"rigged!\" was powerful. (Trump\\'s interjection about The Apprentice deserving an Emmy was genuinely funny, and she almost laughed). One assertion she issued at least three times is that she will not add \"a penny\" to the national debt. This is absolutely, positively ludicrous and false. GOP ad-makers should already be saving those clips for 2020, assuming she wins. That pledge will be broken on day one.\\n(3) Trump was subdued and controlled at the beginning, hitting his talking points on guns and abortion, but allowing her to control both topics. He rebounded in the immigration segment, his comfort zone. The press room groaned and gasped at the \"bad hombres\" line, but he was obviously talking about illegal immigrants who\\'ve committed violent felonies on our soil. I think he won that skirmish. In general, Trump counter-punched throughout the evening, with mixed results. One of his better moments was challenging Hillary to return Clinton Foundation cash donated by misogynistic and homophobic regimes. He pointedly asked whether she\\'d do so, then rambled on too long, distracting himself with another point. She never answered. He let her off the hook. Trump\\'s blanket denials of all the sexual misconduct allegations against him were not credible, and his mentions of the Project Veritas videos (as we predicted) were insufficiently explanatory. At the very least, he may have driven Google traffic to that investigation from curious debate viewers. Though she was much more fluid and informed on foreign policy than he was, Trump got some good jabs in about her record. His effective message: How do you expect this person to fix the mess we face when she\\'s been at or near the center of US power for decades, and she\\'s contributed to the mess? Her failures and unlikeability kept him in the game.\\n(4) Despite again communicating in his patented sentence-fragment-sprinkled word salad, I think he probably battled Clinton to an approximate draw for most of the debate. The big exception was the \"fitness for office\" stretch. She clearly won that exchange, and his decision to repeatedly equivocate on accepting the electoral outcome in November (the \"leave you in suspense\" line felt flat and felt cheap) will dominate a lot of the coverage for the next few days. Trump surrogates will respond with the parable of Al Gore, who dragged the 2000 election out for weeks on end, arguing in court for partial, cherry-picked recounts of counties that he thought could tip Florida\\'s overall tally into his column. (He lost, no matter how you slice it). But Clinton defenders will say that Gore didn\\'t call the legitimacy of the process into question prior to the voting ending, and only pursued a recount under very unusual circumstances. There\\'s a difference between not conceding an historically close election, and baselessly alleging widespread fraud in advance. Both sides will have their talking points on this, but I\\'d guess the American people want to hear their candidates promise to honor the process. Even Trump loyalists like Laura Ingraham quickly conceded this point. And if CBS News\\' Luntz focus group -- which split almost right down the middle for Trump and Clinton overall -- is any indication, Trump\\'s \"rigged\" flirtations on stage hurt him:\\nVoters want the candidates to support the election results.

Trump did not. #Debate pic.twitter.com/LH7J4JPMC2 — Frank Luntz (@FrankLuntz) October 20, 2016\\n(5) One policy point that\\'s stuck in my craw: The final question of the night was about entitlement reform. Chris Wallace laid out the mathematical reality very succinctly. Donald Trump pretended the problem will be solved with magical economic growth. Hillary Clinton talked about taxing the rich and expanding entitlements. Neither of these people is remotely serious about the wave of debt (fueled historically during the Obama era) that is building, and that non-partisan bookkeepers keep warning will swamp us. Very disheartening.

But when Joe Biden was projected on Wednesday to put Wisconsin back in the Democratic column, he was on track to pry back just two of them: Door and Sauk.\\nRather than flipping more Obama-Trump counties, Biden instead exceeded previous Democratic win margins in Wisconsin’s two biggest cities, Milwaukee and Madison.\\nThat pattern extended to Michigan and other battleground states, with Biden building upon Democrats’ dominance in urban and suburban jurisdictions but Trump leaving most of exurban and rural America awash in red.\\nThe urban-rural divide illustrates the pronounced polarization evident in preliminary 2020 election results. The split underscores fundamental disagreements among Americans about how to control the coronavirus pandemic or whether to even try; how to revitalize the economy and restore jobs; how to combat climate change or whether it is an emergency at all; and the roles of morality, empathy and the rule of law in the body politic.\\nAdvertisement\\nBiden is on track to comfortably win the popular vote, and even if he amasses enough of a majority in the electoral college to become the nation’s 46th president, he would lead a bitterly divided country, having fallen short of the resounding repudiation of Trump that many political strategists believed was necessary to extinguish the political fires the president has lit.\\nIndeed, Republicans who yielded their identity as a political party to Trump appear to have won affirmation from some voters. The GOP was poised to maintain its slim majority in the Senate and to gain seats in the House, leaving Democrats with a narrower majority in that chamber.\\nThat leaves the nation potentially heading toward a period of entrenched partisan warfare, even as it is battered by crises.\\n“This is a democracy at full work, but clearly very divided,” said Jim Doyle, a former Democratic governor of Wisconsin. “We are clearly very, very divided by cities and rural, we’re very divided by race. Just look at Wisconsin’s map. And we can’t just be demonizing each other. This is a challenge of leadership that has been building for some time.”\\nShould the Democratic nominee prevail, Doyle said, “Joe Biden has to rise to the occasion almost to FDR, as a Democrat might say, or to Reagan, as a Republican might say, proportions. Half the country are not horrible, racist, mean-spirited people who are different from everybody else. It can’t be. And roughly half the country voted for Trump.”\\nBiden on Wednesday acknowledged the challenges he could face.\\nAdvertisement\\n“It’ll be time for us to do what we’ve always done as Americans, to put the harsh rhetoric of the campaign behind us, to lower the temperature, to see each other again, to listen to one another, to hear each other again, to respect and care for one another, to unite, to heal, to come together as a nation,” Biden said in remarks Wednesday afternoon from his hometown of Wilmington, Del.\\n“I know this won’t be easy,” Biden added. “I know how deep and hard the opposing views are in our country on so many things. But I also know this, as well. To make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as enemies. We are not enemies. What brings us together as Americans is so much stronger than anything that can tear us apart.”\\nSome Democrats believed the pandemic and economic recession might have shaken some voters out of their partisan silos, but that did not pan out, as Biden clung to narrow leads in a number of battleground states. He also lost ground in Florida relative to 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s performance against Trump.\\nAdvertisement\\n“These divisions are deep, but in part, they reflect political choices made over a long period of time,” said William A. Galston, chair of the Brookings Institution’s Governance Studies Program. “We have it in our power to begin to turn this vicious cycle — and it is a vicious cycle — into something more virtuous.”\\nGalston said Trump has benefited from his and his administration’s “relentless focus” throughout his four years in office on appealing to rural and exurban voters “and making it clear that the president understands their interests to be divided from the interests of other parts of the country. There was not a day of unifying rhetoric in the past four years. And Biden was unable to overcome that.”\\nDemocratic pollster Cornell Belcher attributed the divide to more-sinister forces.\\n“Let’s stop pretending that it’s ‘economic anxiety,’ ” Belcher said. “That ugliness is about tribalism. . . . Many of the most hotly contested states are ground zero of the [demographic] changes happening in America: Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Michigan. Where this battle is hottest is where diversity is greatest.”\\nThe early returns laid bare the limits of Trump’s appeal and the political cost for a party that allowed itself to be consumed by him. That process began when Trump thrilled many White Republicans by challenging the legitimacy of the first Black president with a lie about his place of birth, and it culminated four years ago with his stunning defeat of Clinton.\\nAdvertisement\\nTrump’s presidency, while scandal-plagued and animated by his own instincts and feuds, seemed to herald a Republican revival. The party packed the federal judiciary with conservatives, including three justices on the Supreme Court; reversed environmental and other regulations that restricted industry; and slashed taxes on the wealthy and corporations.\\nStill, there is now a lack of clarity about what it means to be a Republican. The party has no common set of facts or an agreed-upon agenda other than supporting Trump. The party’s official 2020 platform shrunk to a brief resolution that assailed the news media and heaped praise on the president.\\nSome veteran Republicans said Trump’s polarizing brand of politics could make it more difficult for the party to build a national majority in the 2022 and 2024 election cycles.\\nAdvertisement\\n“The Republican Party is going up against demography — it’s like a python slowly squeezing it to death,” said GOP strategist Mike Murphy, a Trump critic. “There are not enough White people to survive.”\\nShepherding the party away from its demons remains a challenge without an evident solution or a leader who can eradicate them from the ranks. Even if Trump is defeated, he could remain embedded in the Republican psyche and a lodestar of the GOP’s core activists.\\nShould Biden win, however, he would face a daunting reality on Capitol Hill. Democratic hopes of a united government were dashed Tuesday night, as Republicans appeared on track to hold their narrow majority in the Senate after a number of Democratic challengers fell short of defeating vulnerable GOP incumbents. In the House, Republicans were projected to make considerable gains, which would shrink the size of the Democratic caucus and thus weaken the leverage of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\\nIf Biden becomes president, Democrats expect the GOP to oppose much of his legislative agenda and many of his nominations, just as Republicans did during the Obama presidency.\\nAdvertisement\\n“History doesn’t repeat, but it rhymes,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), fresh off his Tuesday reelection, stands ready to renew the role he played in thwarting Democratic initiatives in the Obama years.\\n“Kentucky wants more of the policies that built the best economy in our nation’s modern history — not socialism,” McConnell said in his victory speech on Tuesday night, nodding toward how Republicans are ready to cast the Democrats as radical.\\nAdditions to the GOP ranks in the chamber include a handful of Trump acolytes, including Sen.-elect Tommy Tuberville in Alabama, a fervent supporter of the president who on Tuesday told his critics to “go to hell and get a job.”\\nOther newly elected Republicans shared that fighting spirit. Madison Cawthorn, who won a House seat in North Carolina — and who, at 25, is set to become the youngest member of Congress — tweeted Tuesday night, “Cry more, lib.”\\nAdvertisement\\nStill, Blumenthal said he and his Democratic colleagues are hopeful that a change in the White House — even if Trump remains a vocal GOP force from outside government — could enable more-centrist Republicans to work with Democrats on issues such as economic relief and infrastructure spending.\\n“Removing the toxic element of Trump could really change things,” Blumenthal said. “I know that sounds like a Pollyanna-ish hope, but Trump’s vile and toxic unpredictability made compromising difficult, and maybe, just maybe, removing Trump from the mix could add a notion of rational thinking and sanity with some Republicans.”\\nDemocrats caution, however, that McConnell may be unwilling to broker bipartisan agreements if he is focused on making gains for his party in the 2022 midterm elections.\\n“Republicans will likely rediscover their love for fiscal discipline after the president spent four years playing base politics,” said Matt House, a former adviser to Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). “It’s hard to see anything more than tonal shifts to win back suburban women. It’s hard to see, tactically and in terms of substance, how they won’t continue to play to their base.”\\nJenna Johnson contributed to this report.\\nGiftOutline Gift Article'], 'https://thehill.com/homenews/media/465836-fox-news-legal-analyst-hunter-bidens-work-overseas-looks-bad-but-none-of-it-is': ['thehill.com', 'Fox News legal analyst: Hunter Biden’s work overseas ‘looks bad, but none of it is criminal’', 'Joe Concha, Hours Ago, Pm Et, Days Ago, Am Et', datetime.datetime(2019, 10, 15, 14, 50, 7), 'Fox News senior judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano said early Tuesday that Hunter Biden’s work overseas “looks bad, but none of it is criminal.”\\n“All of it looks bad, but none of it is criminal.

He’d told a group of left-wing Democratic Congresswomen to “go back” to “the totally broken and crime infested places they came from.” Of the lawmakers Trump appeared to be targeting, all bar one—Ilhan Omar—were born in America. Irrespective of that context, Trump’s attack wasn’t racially charged; it was just racist, by any useful definition of the term. Why didn’t our media say so?\\nICYMI: Social media giants are restricting research vital to journalism\\nOutlets including BuzzFeed, The Guardian, CNN, Mashable, and Rolling Stone did directly call Trump’s tweets “racist” in news articles. The New York Times—which was otherwise responsible for three of the tortured euphemisms above—managed it, too, in a post asking readers to submit their own experiences of the “go back” attack. On Twitter and in opinion pieces, individual reporters and commentators went further. Times columnist Charles M. Blow called Trump “a raging racist”; Goldie Taylor, editor-at-large at The Daily Beast, wrote that Trump’s tweets were “unapologetically racist,” and that “if you support him, so are you.” Jamil Smith, of Rolling Stone, tweeted: “President Trump is a white nationalist, and telling folks to go back to Africa—and to Palestine and Puerto Rico, apparently—is what white nationalists do.”\\nOn the whole, however, the news desks of mainstream news organizations did not call the tweets racist, or at least did not do so consistently across their output. (CNN, for example, used “racist” and “racially charged” in different areas of its coverage.) “Racist” often appeared in quote marks, which was a cop-out: “Reporters and anchors took the story seriously but largely leaned on ‘critics,’ primarily Democrats, and cited their accusations of racism,” CNN’s Brian Stelter notes. Centering the voices of those who experience racism is important, but it is not, in itself, sufficient: here, “the significance of Trump’s words risked being lost in a partisan fog,” as Stelter points out. The Intercept’s Mehdi Hasan was blunter still. “Historians will look back on the US media’s refusal to use the L (lie) and R (racist) words in relation to Trump as one of the most inexcusable, cowardly and shameful features of this horrific political and media era,” he tweeted.\\nThe debate around the “R word” is not new; nor, at this point, does it seem especially controversial. The Associated Press Stylebook—a trusted arbiter for newsrooms nationwide that is hardly known for its leftist radicalism—ruled in March that we should “not use racially charged or similar terms as euphemisms for racist or racism when the latter terms are truly applicable.” (Interestingly, the AP’s lead story on Trump’s tweets does not use either term without attribution.) So why do the euphemisms persist? As has been the case with the “L word,” perhaps a minute parsing of Trump’s intentions is responsible. (Did he mean to be racist/lie? How can we really know…) Maybe institutional style guides have not been adequately updated amid the unceasing torrent of news. The most likely explanation is, perhaps, the simplest: a residual, old-school squeamishness in newsrooms around charged words that—before Trump broke all the rules, at least—smacked of opinion or activism.\\nSign up for CJR 's daily email\\nCalling a president’s words “racist” or “a lie” can legitimately be thorny. Should we throw the words around? Probably not. But we should use them when they accurately reflect the truth. Very simply, that’s our job. Go back to where you came from is textbook racism.

Bolsonaro—wearing a white, Speedo-like bathing suit—was discovered in a small, inflatable boat inside the Tamoios Ecological Station, an area with a half-mile radius that serves as a refuge for penguins, seals, whales, and dolphins in the state of Rio de Janeiro. An agent with the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) issued Bolsonaro a ticket for ten thousand reais, or roughly twenty-five hundred dollars. The following year, Bolsonaro introduced a bill in the legislature that would have barred guards with IBAMA and other environmental agencies from carrying guns, although he was otherwise a longtime defender of gun-ownership rights in Brazil. Later that year, Bolsonaro filed to get legal permission for him—and him alone—to fish in the Tamoios reserve. Ultimately, the fine was dismissed, the bill went nowhere in congress, and the courts decided it would be a bad idea to grant one lawmaker special permission to fish in a sanctuary.\\nLast year, Bolsonaro was elected the President of Brazil, after running a nationalistic campaign that echoed, in many ways, the politics of Donald Trump. A climate-change skeptic, Bolsonaro argued that more land in the Amazon rainforest should be opened for farming, mining, and logging. Under his leadership, IBAMA’s budget has been cut by twenty-four per cent. Bolsonaro has also repeatedly threatened to transform the Tamoios reserve into a Brazilian Cancún, brimming with tourist hotels. The agent who wrote him the ticket for illegal fishing, back in 2012, was fired from a senior government position. And Bolsonaro has installed opponents of environmental regulations in offices throughout his new administration.\\nThis week, Bolsonaro’s disdain for environmental-protection measures attracted global attention when he initially rejected an offer of twenty million dollars in international aid to help fight forest fires burning in the Amazon. The proposed funding was one of the few concrete achievements to come out of the annual G-7 summit of the world’s largest democracies. The French President, Emmanuel Macron, who hosted the meeting in the resort town of Biarritz, insisted that countering the fires should be a top priority. At first, Bolsonaro rejected the aid offer, citing an ongoing feud with Macron in which the two leaders have exchanged insults. Then he said that he would consider accepting the aid if Macron apologized. “He will have to withdraw his words, and then we can talk,” Bolsonaro said.\\nScientists believe that the Amazon’s absorption of greenhouse gases plays a crucial role in slowing climate change. They have declared the spread of fires in the world’s largest rainforest a global crisis. As the forest shrinks, the region is growing progressively drier. Scientists fear that the Amazon could reach a tipping point where its gradual transformation into something closer to a steppe will be irreversible.\\nBolsonaro has dismissed environmental groups’ concerns and encouraged loggers to deforest more of the Amazon. On August 10th, in what became known as Fire Day, farmers in the town of Novo Progresso, in the state of Pará, set fires on their properties to clear land and show their support for Bolsonaro. Satellites operated by Brazil’s space agency detected a surge of wildfires. Now the blazes are so widespread that, last week, smoke darkened the skies over São Paulo, thousands of miles to the south.\\nBased on satellite data, space-agency officials estimate that the number of forest fires is eighty-three per cent larger than last year. Bolsonaro has dismissed these numbers as fake, called environmentalists’ focus on the Amazon a form of “environmental psychosis,” and fired the head of the space agency. The President also claimed that environmental N.G.O.s had set the fires to damage the image of his government.\\nBolsonaro and his cabinet have rolled back environmental regulations across Brazil. His Minister of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply is a former congresswoman known as the “queen of poison,” a reference to her effort to lift restrictions on the use of pesticides. Since Bolsonaro took office, in January, the agriculture ministry has approved hundreds of new pesticide products, some of which have been banned by the European Union. The new head of the Brazilian Forest Service supports allowing jaguars and other endangered species to be hunted in the rainforest. For his environmental-policy czar, Bolsonaro chose an ally of agribusiness named Ricardo Salles, who had been sued when he served as the state environment secretary for São Paulo for altering the borders of an environmentally protected area “with the clear intention of benefiting economic sectors, notably mining.” After Salles was criticized by environmental organizations, Bolsonaro declared, “We got it right.”\\nIBAMA agents have reported being met with increasingly violent responses from miners and forestry workers as they perform their environmental-protection duties. When officials from the agency destroyed equipment used in environmental crime in the Amazon, as per regulations, Bolsonaro criticized them, saying that the government “fine industry” should be shut down. In October, inspectors were stopped halfway across a bridge in an indigenous reserve in the northern state of Rondônia by a group of loggers carrying machetes and sticks. One inspector reported that one of the loggers said, “Now that Bolsonaro has won, this indigenous-land nonsense is over. It’ll all be ours.” In the state of Pará, individuals with links to illegal logging burned down two bridges on the Trans-Amazonian Highway, in retaliation for a crackdown by IBAMA in the area. Since Bolsonaro took office, the agency has carried out no major operations to slow deforestation, and the number of fines imposed by the agency has sunk to its lowest level since 1995.\\nOn the eve of the G-7 summit, Macron called the fires an “ecocide” and threatened to block the free-trade deal between the European Union and Mercosur, a trade bloc consisting of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. Bolsonaro responded by endorsing a post on Facebook that said that the French First Lady, Brigitte Macron, was unattractive. Recent opinion polls have shown a decline in public support for Bolsonaro, as the country’s economy has been slow to recover from a deep recession, and scandals have beset his government. Bolsonaro, however, continues to have one strong supporter. On Tuesday, Trump tweeted, “He is working very hard on the Amazon fires and in all respects doing a great job for the people of Brazil - Not easy.

It’s a complicated thing as you well know; we all have to use anonymous sources, especially in a climate in which the President of the United States tries to actively intimidate journalism organizations and people who provide information to journalism organizations. But the formula is simple: What you do is you have to say, ‘Does the public’s right to know or need to know a particular piece of information outweigh the morally complicated and ambiguous qualities of anonymous sourcing?’”\\n“And so most of us, most of the time, don’t rely on anonymous sourcing for most things, because there are difficulties there,’ Goldberg claimed. “But in this climate, with information that we judge the voters to need, we are going to use anonymous sources because we think the public has a right to know.

Trump displayed the factual command of a small child, the emotional stability of a hormonal teen, and the stamina of an old man, staggering and losing the thread as the 90 minutes wore on. Instead, Republicans — without a single exception I have seen — have responded very differently. They have treated their candidate’s glaring unsuitability for high office as, at worst, a handful of discrete errors that in no way reflect on his character, and at best, the dastardly unfairness of the liberal media.\\nAmong the optimists was conservative columnist Holman Jenkins, who registered his approval with the candidate’s ability to clear two impressive hurdles: make it through the debate without literally dying, and display the ability to make at least one planned action. “He is not a lifelong politician like Mrs. Clinton and it showed,” writes Jenkins. “But he survived on stage. Notice, he also apparently made a strategic decision not to raise Bill Clinton’s infidelities and stuck to it.” Jenkins is at least conceding implicitly that the debate would be considered a loss for Trump if he had keeled over dead. But to pat him on the head for having made a “strategic decision” — i.e., a decision — not to attack Hillary Clinton for her husband’s infidelity and then follow it is setting the bar very low. The ability to follow through on a decision is a developmental step in children that ranks just above object permanence. (Perhaps Jenkins would be impressed if Clinton left during a break and Trump noticed she was gone.) The triumph of Trump planning not to bring up the affairs, and then managing not to, is also mitigated by the fact that he immediately expressed his regret for it afterward.\\nNational Review, which had published a splashy issue devoted to denouncing Trump during the primary, used its post-debate editorial not to remind readers that the array of disqualifying traits it had once denounced were on vivid display, but instead to chastise moderator Lester Holt for exposing them. “We have our criticisms of Donald Trump, too,” wrote National Review, in the only* sentence in the editorial that even hinted at any flaw on Trump’s part. “But his electoral fate should be up to the voters, not Lester Holt and his colleagues.” Likewise, Paul Beston decried Holt’s query to both candidates if they would respect the outcome of the election as his “lowest moment,” asking indignantly, “[H]ow he could even pose such a question.” Perhaps Holt asked because Trump has repeatedly called the election “rigged” and told his supporters that massive fraud is “the only way we can lose.”\\nHolt’s alleged bias was a favorite subject on the right. Every question that exposed Trump’s unprecedented violation of political norms simply proved to conservatives that their party was being singled out for unprecedented scrutiny. Conservatives expressed a mix of resentment and confusion that Trump faced hostile questions and scrutiny for his refusal to take the expected and routine step of releasing his tax returns. They present Trump as an innocent man, guilty of nothing worse than failing to adequately defend himself. “These columns warned Mr. Trump—and GOP voters—during the primaries that by not releasing his returns he was giving Democrats an opening to assert what he might be ‘hiding,’” warns The Wall Street Journal. Note the scare quotes around the term “hiding,” as if it is a hyperbolic and unfair term to apply to the act of not revealing something that is customarily shared. “Trump did not refute Clinton’s charge — reminiscent of Harry Reid’s no-evidence attack on Mitt Romney in 2012 — that Trump pays no federal income taxes,” complains Byron York. “’That makes me smart,’ Trump said, which sounded, if anything, like a confirmation of Clinton’s accusation.” The charge had no evidence, yet Trump said words that sounded to people who understand words like a confirmation of the charge — almost as if the charge is somehow true. Is it possible that Trump is refusing to disclose his returns because they would show something disqualifying? Conservatives do not even consider the scenario anymore. Trump is simply the victim of a combination of insinuation and his own poor salesmanship.\\nThe New York Times, which recently published a harrowing account of Trump’s debate preparation, or lack thereof, today has an equally harrowing account of his failures. Trump surrounds himself with completely unqualified advisers offering bad advice (a “large number of voluble people on his prep team, including two retired military figures with no political background”). His advisers are hoping after the first debate to “impress upon him the need to stick to a strategy and a plan of battle.” Trump has a childlike attention span (“he did not seem to pay attention during the practice sessions”) and found his efforts at serious preparation derailed by the influence of serial predator Roger Ailes, who turned the sessions into gripefests around the fallout from his serial predation:\\nThere were early efforts to run a more standard form of general election debate-prep camp, led by Roger Ailes, the ousted Fox News chief, at Mr. Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, N.J. But Mr. Trump found it hard to focus during those meetings, according to multiple people briefed on the process who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. That left Mr. Ailes, who at the time was deeply distracted by his removal from Fox and the news media reports surrounding it, discussing his own problems as well as recounting political war stories, according to two people present for the sessions.\\nSo Trump, according to the people trying to help him win, is unable to pick good staff, manage his time, follow advice, or even accept the connection between preparing for an event and succeeding at it. Republicans have so internalized Trump’s wild unsuitability for the presidency that they have decided to treat these facts as mere hurdles to overcome on the path to the presidency. But why are they trying to help him win in the first place?\\nUpdate: The sentence I originally cited was not the editorial’s only criticism of Trump. National Review’s editorial does gently upbraid him for failing to anticipate the unfair questioning he faced, and for not adequately attacking his opponent: “The institutional slant of the media being what it is, the Republican nominee is always at a disadvantage when it comes to debate moderators, and should prepare accordingly. It was clear from his performance last night that Trump did not adequately prepare for what were entirely predictable lines of questioning; he also missed several opportunities to go on the offensive against a uniquely vulnerable opponent.”'], 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-team-bets-impeachment-will-backfire-on-democrats-11569453432': ['wsj.com', 'Trump Team Bets Impeachment Will Backfire on Democrats', 'Michael C.

Donald Trump made getting fair dealing on trade a major plank in his campaign platform and has followed through. China can’t say it wasn’t warned about the imposition this week of additional tariffs on selected goods coming into the United States.\\nBad trade deals have cost the United States billions of dollars and cost millions of American workers their jobs over the last several decades. Supporters of free trade find tariffs against China, Europe, Mexico and Canada hard to take. Tariffs are taxes hiding under another name and lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. The stock market dropped 500 points after the new China tariffs were announced. Tariffs provide a safe harbor for inefficiencies, and protect markets and manufacturers from the need to innovate and increase productivity. But as a short-term strategy to get the Chinese to the table to make agreements to protect American intellectual property, for example, it might be that rare occasion on which to do something bad so that good may come. A tariff strategy worked with the Europeans, and for Japan, Mexico and Canada, and now they’re talking about new trade deals that critics of the president said would never happen.\\nMr. Trump must remember that a deal on paper and signed is only the beginning. Other signatories to a deal will be tempted to cheat if they think they can get away with it. This is what’s happening now with Qatar, which by being too clever by half found a workaround to an agreement it concluded with the United States regarding the operation of the heavily subsidized Qatar Airways.\\nUnder a deal cut a year-and-a-half ago under Open Skies, an international regulatory regime meant to enable open entry into a nation’s airspace, an airline must not use government subsidies to establish lower fares in competition with U.S. carriers.\\nQatar, a nominal U.S. ally and host to the largest American military base in the Gulf, agreed to terms in January 2018 it is now subverting through its purchase of a 49 % share in an Italian carrier it renamed Air Italy. Soon afterward, Air Italy said it would offer bargain-rate flights from Milan to New York, Miami, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Qatar is using Air Italy to get access to gates at U.S. airports it said it would not pursue under its own name. The word for that is cheating. Qatar Airways is not being shy about it. Air Italy is operating flights with Qatar Airways aircraft, with financing provided by the Qatar government. Its financial statements show Qatar Airways covers Air Italy’s operating losses. Air Italy’s chief operating officer and ranking executives are former Qatar Airways senior executives. Air Italy crew uniforms that are just like those worn by Qatar Airways crews.\\nThis hasn’t escaped the notice of U.S. carriers, which are rightly angry about it. American advocates on Capitol Hill, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a conservative Republican, and Bob Menendez of New Jersey, a liberal Democrat, are trying to do something about it. They’re asking the Trump administration what it intends to do. Unless pushed, probably nothing.\\nQatar must be called to account, and not just for its own mischief but for the message that would send to the Chinese and other major U.S. trading partners. If Qatar Airways continues to use Air Italy as its proxy, and gets by with it, that would tell China, Japan, Mexico, Canada and Europe they can agree to trade deals and if they’re caught cheating the United States will look the other way.

Sorry, but they do.\\nThe fourth Democratic presidential primary debate opened by asking all 12 participants about impeachment. Once the round-robin was finished, CNN’s Anderson Cooper turned to Joe Biden and asked this carefully phrased question:\\nThe impeachment inquiry is centered on President Trump’s attempts to get political dirt on Vice President Biden and his son. President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. I want to point out there’s no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you. Having said that, on Sunday, you announced if you are president, no one in your family will be involved in any foreign businesses. My question is, if it’s not okay for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it okay for your son when you were vice president?\\n“My son did nothing wrong,” Biden replied. “I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. That’s what we should be focusing on.”\\nChastened, the moderators moved on to ask Elizabeth Warren about whether she’d raise taxes to pay for Medicare-for-all. But even that, apparently, had been too much. A few minutes later, asked his views on a federal job guarantee, Sen. Cory Booker denounced the moderators for subjecting Biden to such humiliating scrutiny. “I saw this play in 2016’s election,” he said. “We are ... elevating a lie and attacking a statesman. That was so offensive. The only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was Donald Trump.”\\nA few things are true about the Hunter Biden story. One is that there’s no evidence Joe Biden did what Donald Trump has accused him of doing: pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor to protect his son from investigation.\\nBut another is that Hunter Biden poses real problems for Joe Biden’s campaign, and if Democrats pretend otherwise, they’re making a mistake.\\nMany Democrats consider raising the Hunter Biden question unfair to Joe Biden. Why should he have to answer for the legal actions of his adult son? But no one said politics was fair. And if Democrats avoid the issue, they can be certain Trump will not. Biden’s vulnerability here needs to be tested in the primary, when Democrats have other choices, rather than in the general, when they won’t.\\nThe problems Hunter Biden creates for Joe Biden\\nHunter Biden isn’t a natural gas expert, and he’s not a Ukraine expert. But he was son of the then vice president of the United States. And that’s why he was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to sit on Burisma’s board — among others. The New Yorker’s investigation, which predates the revelation of Trump’s call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, put it well:\\nSeveral former officials in the Obama Administration and at the State Department insisted that Hunter’s role at Burisma had no effect on his father’s policies in Ukraine, but said that, nevertheless, Hunter should not have taken the board seat. As the former senior White House aide put it, there was a perception that “Hunter was on the loose, potentially undermining his father’s message.” The same aide said that Hunter should have recognized that at least some of his foreign business partners were motivated to work with him because they wanted “to be able to say that they are affiliated with Biden.” A former business associate said, “The appearance of a conflict of interest is good enough, at this level of politics, to keep you from doing things like that.”\\nIt wasn’t illegal for Hunter Biden to take that job. But Hunter Biden himself has admitted it was “poor judgment.” It’s reminiscent of nothing so much as the $675,000 Hillary Clinton took for giving speeches to Goldman Sachs: not illegal, but a kind of soft corruption that voters find loathsome.\\nClinton and Biden both make the same argument: The money — in Clinton’s case direct, in Biden’s case to his son — didn’t affect their decisions. I believe Biden on this. But these are huge sums and represent a kind of DC back-scratching and influence-trading that voters dislike. Getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for doing basically no work is a rare gift, and the cost of accepting that gift or of letting a family member accept it is it can be used against you in a future election.\\nNone of this is news to Biden. As the Intercept’s Ryan Grim documented, Biden has faced attacks for decades over not just Hunter’s work, but his brother James’s efforts to cash in on his name, so he knew this was a vulnerability long before Burisma. Biden’s answer here seems to have been to create a personal firewall about the topics he’d discuss with Hunter. “I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having do with Ukraine,” he said. “No one has indicated I have. We kept everything separate.”\\nWhat’s unusual about this case is Hunter Biden appears to have inadvertently done his country a great service: He lured Donald Trump into openly extorting a foreign country to investigate the son of a domestic political rival. It’s an important revelation that has launched an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump and may help Democrats win back the White House. But is Joe Biden going to be the strongest Democratic contender in this conversation? Or will his ability to make the case be compromised, as every time he attacks Trump for soliciting foreign assistance, Trump will counter with allegations about why exactly Hunter Biden was being paid so much money by a Ukrainian natural gas giant?\\nHere is a list of people who have criticized Hunter Biden of Nepotism in the last 24 hours:\\nPresented to you by 23andMe.\\nMeghan McCain\\nAbby Huntsman\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nIvanka Trump\\nJaren Kushner\\nRand Paul\\nMs. Romney (Ronna) — YS (@NYinLA2121) October 15, 2019\\nHunter Biden’s exploits also make it hard for Biden to launch what should be a broader, and damning, attack on Trump: that he’s compromised and corrupted the government through nepotism and self-dealing. Twitter is full of liberals mocking the hypocrisy of the Trump children for attacking Biden, but the money Hunter Biden made trading on the Biden name weakens Joe Biden’s ability to make the case against Trump’s nepotism and corruption, even though it’s clearly one of Trump’s core vulnerabilities.\\nHunter Biden and Hillary’s emails\\nBooker, like other Democrats I’ve heard, analogized talking about Hunter Biden’s job in Ukraine to talking about Hillary Clinton’s emails — an unfair smear that is legitimized when raised by the media or other candidates. “I am having deja vu all over again,” he said.\\nMe too, but for a different reason.\\nIn 2016, Bernie Sanders famously refused to attack Clinton’s emails in the debates. “The American people are sick and tired about hearing about your damn emails,” he said to applause. The result was that rather than Democrats realizing how damaging that story was — and how ineffective Clinton was at putting it to rest — during the primary, they found that out in the general election. And yes, the media deserves the blame for the coverage decisions, but Democrats can’t simply assume the media won’t make the same mistakes in 2020. The lesson of Clinton’s emails is that unfair smears can help Donald Trump get elected.\\nI’m not arguing that any of this disqualifies Joe Biden. He may yet prove the strongest Democratic candidate. But it would be unwise for Democrats to refuse to scrutinize him out of some misplaced sense that admitting the vulnerability is playing into Trump’s hands or is unfair to Biden. What would be playing into Trump’s hands is ignoring an obvious vulnerability so that he can exploit it later.\\nListen to Today, Explained\\nIn the fourth Democratic debate, the candidates treated Elizabeth Warren as the frontrunner.

On Sunday, President Trump, blaming Beijing for reneging on previously negotiated commitments, tweeted a threat to the effect that he would raise an existing 10 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25 percent on Friday, with 25 percent tariffs on additional Chinese goods coming “shortly.”\\nNews reports identify the Trump administration’s specific complaint as China’s alleged going back on its promises to put U.S.-requested policy changes into law. For their part, Chinese sources have told Western media that Beijing interpreted Mr. Trump’s complaints about purportedly tight Federal Reserve monetary policy as a sign of economic weakness that China could exploit.\\nIt’s anyone guess what will come of the current meetings in Washington between China’s trade delegation and Mr. Trump’s team. What should not be in doubt, however, is that throughout the entire bargaining process with Beijing, the administration has undercut its position by attempting to wage simultaneous tariff battles with other countries. As Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics has shown, Mr. Trump’s tariffs now cover 50.5 percent of Chinese imports — but also 7.3 percent of imports from Canada, 2.5 percent of imports from the European Union, 9.6 percent of imports from South Korea and 3.8 percent of imports from Japan.\\nAdvertisement\\nThough still modest in their economic impact, the tariffs have symbolism that stings these long-standing U.S. allies and trading partners. For the most part, they do not abuse international trade rules as China does. Indeed, they share many of the United States’ concerns with Chinese protectionism, theft of intellectual property and subsidized state enterprises. Yet by bracketing old friends with Beijing, even justifying some levies against them (on steel and aluminum) on “national security” grounds, Mr. Trump has made it politically difficult for them to rally to the U.S. side in the dispute with China. They were in fact obliged to retaliate.\\nFollow Editorial Board 's opinions Follow\\nThis unforced error is doubly regrettable because Mr. Trump arguably had the upper hand going into his talks with China. The Chinese economy is more dependent on exports to the United States than vice-versa, and China’s growth rate has been slowing, while the U.S. economy (contrary to Mr. Trump’s inappropriate and ill-founded gripes about Fed policy) is creating jobs at a brisk pace. In a world where Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular, his complaints — shared by previous U.S. presidents — against China represented a rare case in which other nations conceded him the moral high ground. A savvier president would take advantage of that.\\nThe negotiations with China may yet reach a mutually beneficial conclusion, or they may collapse. Either way, Mr. Trump will have defied a lesson of history: Multiple-front wars are the hardest to win, whether they are of the military kind or trade wars. Fighting without allies is harder still.\\nAdvertisement\\nRead more:\\nGiftOutline Gift Article\"], 'https://apnews.com/d78192d45b176f73ad435ae9fb926ed3': ['apcom', 'President Donald Trump impeached by US House, 3rd in history', 'Lisa Mascaro, Mary Clare Jalonick', datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 20, 11, 41, 56), 'House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., speaks as the House of Representatives debates the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Dec. 18, 2019.

She called it “great day for the Constitution of the United States, a sad one for America that the president’s reckless activities necessitated us having to introduce articles of impeachment.”\\nTrump, who began Wednesday tweeting his anger at the proceedings, pumped his fist before an evening campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan, boasting of “tremendous support” in the Republican Party.\\n“By the way,” he told the crowd, “it doesn’t feel like I’m being impeached.”\\nThe mood in the House chamber shifted throughout the day as the lawmakers pushed toward the vote.

The votes for impeachment were 230-197-1 on the first charge, 229-198-1 on the second. To mark the moment, voting was conducted manually with ballots.\\nWhile Democrats had the majority in the House to impeach Trump, a vote of two-thirds is necessary for conviction in the Republican-controlled Senate. The trial is expected to begin in January, but Pelosi was noncommittal about sending the House articles over, leaving the start date uncertain. Senate leaders are expecting to negotiate details of the trial, but Democrats are criticizing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for saying he won’t be an impartial juror and already knows the outcome.\\nWhat Pelosi called a sad and solemn moment for the country, coming in the first year after Democrats swept control of the House, unfolded in a caustic daylong session that showcased the nation’s divisions.\\nThe House impeachment resolution laid out in stark terms the articles of impeachment against Trump stemming from his July phone call when he asked the Ukrainian president for a “favor” — to announce he was investigating Democrats including potential 2020 rival Joe Biden.\\nAt the time, Zelenskiy, new to politics and government, was seeking a coveted White House visit to show backing from the U.S. as he confronted a hostile Russia at his border. He was also counting on $391 million in military aid already approved by Congress. The White House delayed the funds, but Trump eventually released the money once Congress intervened.\\nNarrow in scope but broad in its charges, the impeachment resolution said the president “betrayed the nation by abusing his high office to enlist a foreign power in corrupting democratic elections,” and then obstructing Congress’ oversight like “no president” in U.S. history.\\n“President Trump, by such conduct, has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office,” it said.\\nRepublicans argued that Democrats were impeaching Trump because they can’t beat him in 2020.\\nSaid Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah: “They want to take away my vote and throw it in the trash.”\\nBut Democrats warned the country cannot wait for the next election to decide whether Trump should remain in office because he has shown a pattern of behavior, particularly toward Russia, and will try to corrupt U.S. elections again.\\n“The president and his men plot on,” said Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of the Intelligence Committee that led the inquiry. “The danger persists. The risk is real.”\\nThe outcome brings the Trump presidency to a milestone moment that has been building almost from the time the New York businessman-turned-reality-TV host unexpectedly won the White House in 2016 amid questions about Russian interference in the U.S. election.\\nDemocrats drew from history, the founders and their own experiences, including as minorities, women and some immigrants to the U.S., who spoke of seeking to honor their oath of office to uphold the Constitution. Rep. Lou Correa of California delivered his comments in English and Spanish asking God to unite the nation. “In America,” said Hakeem Jeffries of New York, “no one is above the law.”\\nRepublicans aired Trump-style grievances about what Arizona Rep. Debbie Lesko called a “rigged” process.\\n“We face this horror because of this map,” said Rep. Clay Higgins of Alabama before a poster of red and blue states. “They call this Republican map flyover country, they call us deplorables, they fear our faith, they fear our strength, they fear our unity, they fear our vote, and they fear our president.”\\nThe political fallout from the vote will reverberate across an already polarized country with divergent views of Trump’s July phone call when he asked Zelenskiy to investigate Democrats in the 2016 election, Biden and Biden’s son Hunter, who worked on the board of a gas company in Ukraine while his father was the vice president.\\nTrump has repeatedly implored Americans to read the transcript of the call he said was “perfect.” But the facts it revealed, and those in an anonymous whistleblower’s complaint that sparked the probe, are largely undisputed.\\nMore than a dozen current and former White House officials and diplomats testified for hours in impeachment hearings. The open and closed sessions under oath revealed what one called the “irregular channel” of foreign policy run by Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, which focused on investigating the Bidens and alternative theories of 2016 election interference.\\nThe question for lawmakers was whether the revelations amounted to impeachable offenses.\\nFew lawmakers crossed party lines.\\nOn the first article, abuse of power, two Democrats, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who is considering switching parties to become a Republican, and Collin Peterson of Minnesota voted against impeaching Trump.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Mr. Trump had committed a “betrayal” of the Constitution.\\nDOCUMENT: Transcript of Trump’s call with Ukrainian president\\nThe president and his team say Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter, should be investigated for receiving $3 million from a Ukrainian energy company while his father was serving as vice president.\\nBut the transcript, compiled from notes taken by White House aides during the phone call, shows that Mr. Trump did not link the military aid to any promise from Ukraine for an investigation of his main Democratic rival.\\nWhile there’s no overt link to U.S. military aid, Mr. Trump does ask Mr. Zelensky for a “favor” immediately after reminding the Ukrainian leader that the U.S. has spent “a lot of effort and a lot of time” on Ukraine.\\n“I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,” Mr. Trump said on the call. “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike … I guess you have one of your wealthy people… The [DNC] server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on the whole situation … I would like to have the Attorney General [Mr. Barr] call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.”\\nCrowdStrike was hired by the DNC initially to examine its servers in the Russian hacking affair. The DNC never turned over the servers to the FBI.\\nThe president also mentions the just-completed investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller over unfounded allegations of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. Mr. Trump and his lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, believe the so-called “witch hunt” investigation had its origins in Ukraine.\\n“They say a lot of it started with Ukraine,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Zelensky. “Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”\\nMr. Trump said the U.S. is helping Ukraine “much more than the European countries are doing, and they should be helping you more than they are.”\\n“Germany does almost nothing for you,” Mr. Trump said. “The United States has been very, very good to Ukraine. I wouldn’t say that it’s reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good, but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.”\\nMr. Zelensky replied, “You are absolutely right. I’m very grateful to you for that because the United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine. Much more than the European Union especially, when we are talking about sanctions against the Russian Federation.”\\nDemocrats said the transcript shows the president’s actions were worse than they expected. Republicans said it proves the president did nothing wrong.\\nSen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, said “I don’t mind” that Mr. Trump raised the Bidens during the call.\\n“I think it’s very appropriate for the president of the United States to suggest [to Ukraine] that you’ve got a corruption problem,” Mr. Graham told reporters. “Did the president of the United States suggest to the Ukraine, ‘I will withhold money unless you go after my political rival’? The answer is absolutely not. That’s why I wanted the phone call to be released.”\\nMr. Graham said Mr. Biden’s son “was receiving money from the Ukraine, was on the board of a company that was the subject of an investigation.”\\n“If you don’t see that conflict, you’re blind,” he said.\\nMr. Trump said Wednesday the transcript would show that Democrats owe him an apology for rushing to an impeachment inquiry without the facts.\\n“Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President?” The president tweeted. “They should, a perfect call - got them by surprise!”\\nMr. Trump is scheduled to meet with Mr. Zelensky later Wednesday at the United Nations in New York.\\nWhite House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said the transcript shows “the president has done nothing wrong here.”\\n“There is no quid pro quo and there is no pressure,” Mr. Gidley said on Fox News. “As the president has said, it was pitch-perfect. The Democrats are already calling for impeachment when they didn’t have the facts in the first place. Evidence doesn’t matter to Democrats at all.”\\n• Dave Boyer can be reached at dboyer@washingtontimes.com.'], 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/fake-news-trump-denies-new-york-times-report-on-his-tax-returns': ['washingtonexaminer.com', \"'Fake news': Trump denies New York Times report on his tax returns\", '', datetime.datetime(2020, 9, 27, 22, 13, 47), 'President Trump denied a report that said he paid just $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and his first year in office.\\nThe New York Times published a report on Trump\\'s financial information, which he has long kept out of public view, about half an hour before the president held a news conference in the White House on Sunday.

That, of course, is why these occasions exist. But in 2020, the Republican narrative is a commodity, giving the RNC an allure with exasperated corporate media consumers who recognize they aren’t being served by mainstream journalists.\\nI have no idea how big this audience is, or whether it’s large enough to boost the ratings. But it’s exactly the kind of programming that rocketed podcasters and YouTubers such as Joe Rogan into the stratosphere, attracting larger audiences than cable networks in some cases. Why? Because it’s the story the corporate media refuses to tell. The Trump presidency finally helped people beyond the conservative movement recognize the severity of media corruption, creating a broader audience for the other side of the story.\\nPro-Trump addresses from speakers such as Herschel Walker, Andrew Pollack, Mark and Patricia McCloskey, Tim Scott, and Maximo Alvarez contained compelling personal narratives that get zero oxygen in the corporate media. It’s not that the audience for this kind of content is a MAGA army of transitioning “walk away” Republicans; it’s that curious consumers are increasingly aware the media is ignoring one side of the argument — presupposing its evilness — and are eager to hear what’s being kept from them. They’re sick of hostile filters.\\nEven a politician like Nikki Haley meets these criteria. Her remarks on Black Lives Matter, which vigorously affirmed the dignity of every person, finally brought a cogent conservative argument about racial justice to prime-time television. Haley wouldn’t have a chance to make that argument outside Fox News without being filtered through adversarial coverage, overt or subtle.\\nThat’s what drives people to Rogan. Several years into this trend, corporate media still has no clue that the success of heterodox programming, which allows anti-progressive voices a civil platform to make their arguments, is related to their own inability to do the same. People know they’re not getting the full story, and they want it. Honest conversation, by the way, makes for much more entertaining content anyway.\\nRoughly half the voting population cast a ballot for Donald Trump, but their representation in corporate media is slim and almost always slanted unfairly. Nobody outside the MSNBC faithful wants to watch that.\\nJudging by the left’s reaction to the first night of the convention, they are still clearly too terrified and too ignorant to understand why it’s better for business and journalism to give people like the McCloskeys or pro-Trump Alvarez a fair platform. That’s why they’ll continue losing trust and losing viewers, while clips from the RNC affect more people than they could predict.\\nNew media is thriving because of corporate media corruption. They’ve created an exploding demand for heterodox perspectives, perspectives that undercut the elite narrative that everyone to the right of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is bigoted, whether they’re black like Tim Scott or immigrants like Alvarez. The legacy outlets are losing their monopoly. The RNC isn’t exactly an episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience,” but like Rogan, it’s giving people the corporate media ignores a fair chance to tell their stories.\\nEmily Jashinsky is culture editor at The Federalist and host of Federalist Radio Hour.

We don’t need any more, and these are problems like we’ve never seen before.”\\nThe screening would exclude people who support Shariah law, he said, referring to the legal system based on Islam that some followers believe supersedes secular law.\\n“In the Cold War, we had an ideological screening test. The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today,” he said.\\nPresenting the threat of terrorism in the starkest terms, Mr. Trump said tougher immigration policies must be part of an aggressive strategy to eradicate radical Islam’s “ideology of hatred,” much like the U.S. defeated Nazis and the Soviet Union in the 20th century.\\nMr. Trump’s plan to test people who want to enter the United States mirrored some of the requirements on the citizenship test. However, the test would be applied to people seeking to visit or temporarily live in the U.S.\\nTerrorism is a top issue in the presidential campaign and potentially Mr. Trump’s best opening to challenge Mrs. Clinton, who served as secretary of state under Mr. Obama as the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL, grew into a global powerhouse.\\nMr. Trump began his address minutes after Mrs. Clinton and Vice President Joseph R. Biden were savaging his foreign policy and questioning his fitness to be commander in chief during a joint rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania.\\nA Pew Research Center survey last month found that 84 percent of registered voters nationwide named the economy as a “very important” concern in the election, and 80 percent named “terrorism.”\\nClinton and the Islamic State\\nA week after accusing Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton of being founders of the terrorist group, Mr. Trump detailed how the Islamic State spread on Mrs. Clinton’s watch as secretary of state, including her failed policies in Libya and Syria.\\n“Incident after incident proves again and again: Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment, the temperament and the moral character to lead this nation,” he said. “Importantly, she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS and all the many adversaries we face — not only in terrorism, but in trade and every other challenge we must confront to turn this country around.”\\nThe other two prongs of Mr. Trump’s strategy against terrorism involved foreign policy.\\nMr. Trump advocated for a concerted effort abroad to destroy the Islamic State and other radical Islamic terrorist groups, including military strikes on their strongholds, cutting off their financial resources and using cyberwarfare to shut down their online propaganda and recruiting tools.\\nIn supporting those efforts, he proposed to end U.S. nation-building efforts in troubled states and to team up with countries that back the campaign against radical Islamic groups. He said Cold War foe Russia could be a valuable ally in the fight despite tensions on other fronts.\\n“We cannot always choose our friends, but we can never fail to recognize our enemies,” said Mr. Trump.\\nJohn R. Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who has been supportive of Mr. Trump, told Fox News that the candidate demonstrated “command on the subject matter” and appeared presidential.\\nHowever, the speech did little to satisfy Mr. Trump’s critics in national security circles.\\n“The policies and ‘pillars’ that were offered as solutions were often vague, and it is not clear they’d actually solve the serious challenges that exist in the region,” said Brian Nussbaum, a terrorism analyst at Rockefeller College of Public Affairs & Policy at the University at Albany, State University of New York. “As in several other areas of policy, Trump’s approach to foreign policy and national security seems a bit nebulous, focused on slogans rather concrete policies.”\\nAhead of the speech, the Clinton campaign called Mr. Trump “erratic,” “thin-skinned” and “vindictive” and blasted his foreign policy proposals.\\n“Simply put, Donald Trump is unfit to be our commander in chief. This isn’t overcranked campaign rhetoric — national security experts across the political spectrum are issuing the same warning,” Clinton campaign senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan wrote in a memo.\\nThe ferocity of the pre-emptive strike against Mr. Trump underscored how vulnerable Mrs. Clinton is to criticism about terrorism and her record as secretary of state.\\nThe memo argued that Mrs. Clinton, who also was first lady and a U.S. senator, was “uniquely qualified” to be commander in chief, compared with Mr. Trump, who he said was “uniquely unqualified.”\\n“The choice is clear,” Mr. Sullivan wrote. “It’s not a choice between a Democrat and a Republican, but between a responsible leader who will keep us safe, and a volatile man who threatens our security.”\\n• S.A.

Cleveland Is A Former Full-Time University Faculty Member\", datetime.datetime(2022, 8, 17, 11, 59), \"The FBI’s raid on Mar-a-Lago reveals the deep-state cabal and their corrupt media partners deployed no fewer than 10 of the same tradecrafts used to push the Russia-collusion hoax. And with that, history is repeating itself with the same corrupt plot.\\n1. A Shocking Storyline of Trump Putting America at Risk\\nWith the Russia-collusion hoax, Democrats and a complicit media cartel warned the country that Trump’s relationship with Russia presented a clear and present danger to America. While the reporting oscillated from Trump being too pally with Vladimir Putin to Putin having leverage over Trump, to Trump being a Russian agent, the narrative underlying the hoax was one that, if true, presented the public with a serious national security concern.\\nSimilarly, the hoax surrounding the search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home rests on claimed misconduct which, if true, raises concerns of a dire national security crisis. Like having a Russian stooge or agent in the White House, Trump keeping supposedly top-secret documents unsecured in his Florida home suggests a serious threat to our national security.\\nIn both cases, the seriousness of the supposed threat to America’s national security seeks to justify the government’s extreme measures to target Trump.\\n2. The Building of a Narrative\\nTo support the idea that Trump’s supposed misconduct created a serious risk to America, both the Biden administration and the press quickly converged on the “classified materials” narrative. But none of the crimes on which the Mar-a-Lago search warrant was premised involved crimes related to the illegal possession or storage of “classified materials.” Nonetheless, the media coverage immediately framed the raid as based on the presence of “classified” and even “top secret” materials. Supposed government sources even went so far as to claim the material kept at Trump’s home related to nuclear secrets.\\nCoverage of the raid sought to further cement this narrative in the public’s consciousness by quoting past public officials bemoaning Trump’s disregard for American secrets. By quickly framing the raid as concerning classified materials, the bad guys hoped the public would ignore the outrageousness of a search of a former president’s home. The backlash came nonetheless, but had the public understood that the fight concerned documents desired by the United States archivist, even stronger pushback would have been likely.\\nThis same scenario played out with SpyGate, with the supposed standard-bearers of journalism reporting Trump and his campaign’s every connection to Russia to create a backdrop against which Trump would be believed to be a Russian collaborator. But unlike SpyGate, Americans have seen this show before and recognize the plot.\\n3. Leaks, Leaks Everywhere, and Not a Name to Seek\\nTo build their preferred narrative, the Department of Justice and the FBI began leaking like a spigot. While Attorney General Merrick Garland stoically proclaimed during his press statement that he will speak through his court filings, his underlings sowed various storylines throughout the press — and always as unnamed sources.\\nAmericans saw the same scenario from 2016 on, when leaks to the media revealed everything from the FISA surveillance of Carter Page, to the briefing of President Donald Trump on the salacious details of the Steele dossier. The leaks, then, sought to further the Russia-collusion storyline, and now they seek to push the idea that Trump committed a crime that threatens our country’s national security.\\n4. Same Suspicious Names\\nThe names of the players involved in the Russia-collusion hoax and the hoax that’s going nuclear represent the fourth similarity. With the Russia-collusion hoax, the New York Times and the Washington Post served as the unofficial scribes for the government leakers, pushing whatever storylines best furthered the plots.\\nShortly after news of the raid broke, the New York Times and the Washington Post began running tips from “unnamed government sources” “familiar with the investigation.” Not only were the same outlets used to peddle the DOJ and FBI’s selected and slanted leaks, but some of the same journalists involved in the Russia hoax have been covering the raid, such as Tom Hamburger whose emails with Fusion GPS exposed his connection to the scandal.\\nAnd then there’s Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who lied to the American public about the FISA applications used to surveil Carter Page. Schiff quickly expressed concern about the “top secret documents” the feds seized from Mar-a-Lago, but he remains snail-slow in apologizing for perpetuating the Russia-collusion hoax.\\n5. Don’t Question Authority\\nSchiff also pushed another ploy used in earlier get-Trump hoaxes, namely condemning criticism of the FBI. “The GOP’s unfounded attacks on the FBI are grossly irresponsible,” Schiff wrote in reference to criticism of the raid, adding that it “will only lead to further violence, if they do not stop.” Schiff’s comments add to those made by FBI Director Christopher Wray and Garland, both of whom chastised those who dared call into question the FBI’s integrity.\\nThe country witnessed a similar going-on-the-offensive counter to complaints over the handling of the Russia investigation. But after four years of government officials defending the men and women of the FBI and the DOJ’s handling of Crossfire Hurricane, Americans discovered the rot ran straight through to the top. So the silence-them schtick seen of late is unlikely to work this time.\\n6. Changing Narratives\\nAnother ploy unlikely to go unnoticed by the country after living through six years of the SpyGate scandal concerns the ever-changing justifications provided for the government’s targeting of a political enemy. Within the course of one week, a complicit media rolled out for the feds a constantly changing series of excuses for the Rubicon-crossing raid.\\nFirst, the possible presence of “nuclear secrets” justified the raid, and then when social media mocked that theory, the press moved to the need to protect “classified documents.” Next, the media floated the idea that videos suggested the documents were not secure and then changed the storyline again to say Trump people might be secretly moving the documents. Later came the theory that a confidential human source prompted the search, and later the rationale changed to the search being justified by a supposed lie Trump’s attorney told that there were no documents present at Mar-a-Lago marked classified.\\nThe justification-of-the-day routine hearkens back to the changing rationales proffered to support Crossfire Hurricane. It was a tip about George Papadopoulos — well that and all these folks having connections to Russia. It wasn’t really the Steele dossier until it was again. But wait, the firing of FBI Director James Comey — that needs investigation too.\\nNothing stood up then as a solid justification because nothing mattered but getting Trump. Everything else was a pretext. Nothing stands up to scrutiny now either.\\n7. Court Filings Are Too Important to Share\\nAnother similarity between the hoaxes concerns the need to keep the court filings secret. In SpyGate, it took years before the government released the FISA applications submitted to obtain a court order to surveil Carter Page. And once released, the redactions made much of the information useless. Later, additional disclosures and the inspector general’s report on FISA abuse revealed that the FISA applications, on which the government obtained court approval to spy on Page, were replete with false representations and material omissions. Those applications proved so defective, in fact, that the government later conceded probable cause did not support the surveillance of Page.\\nIn the case of the raid on Mar-a-Lago, the government similarly claims the search warrant application is too vital to be released. As a matter of law, the DOJ’s position is sound. As a matter of lessons learned, the secrecy surrounding the affidavit raises serious concerns that the basis for the search of Trump’s home would not withstand public scrutiny.\\n8. The Return of the Confidential Human Source\\nAmong the leaks spread over the last week, the most familiar one concerned the FBI’s claimed use of a confidential human source. That CHS provided the FBI with important evidence concerning the documents stored at Mar-a-Lago and reportedly informed the government that Trump had withheld more documents than agents knew. This reporting by the CHS supposedly led the FBI to move forward with the search warrant application.\\nThe Crossfire Hurricane investigation also involved the FBI’s use of CHS, such as Christopher Steele, Stefan Halper, and Rodney Joffe. And that experience leaves Americans leery of the news that a CHS provided the intel necessary to obtain the search warrant.\\n9. A Partisan Bureaucrat with a Disdain for Trump\\nAs stories of Russia collusion began to unravel, Americans also learned of the anti-Trump sentiments shared by many of the agents on the Crossfire Hurricane team. The text exchanges between Lisa Page and Peter Strzok first woke the country to the reality that politics played a part in the probe. Later, an independent investigation into the prosecution of retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn revealed a “get Trump” attitude permeated the entire investigation.\\nWhile it has not yet been even two weeks since the FBI raided Mar-a-Lago, substantial evidence of a political motive already exists. First, we have the disparate treatment between the former Republican president and the Democrat president’s son who is under investigation and has been since 2018. Then there’s the difference between the FBI’s kid-glove handling of Hillary Clinton and the raid used with Trump. The latter difference proves especially enlightening because both cases involved the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).\\nWhen NARA, which until late April 2022, was led by head archivist David S. Ferriero, learned of Clinton’s use of a non-governmental email account, Ferriero did not “initiate[] an ‘Investigation’ of Secretary Clinton’s email practices.” Instead, he communicated “with the State Department on this matter” and “deferr[ed] to the State Department’s review (and any other agencies conducting Investigations).”\\nIn contrast, after NARA retrieved 15 boxes of presidential records from Mar-a-Lago and discovered some contained documents marked as classified, NARA immediately requested that the DOJ investigate the matter. The DOJ then used a grand jury to subpoena documents from Trump, as well as to obtain footage from security cameras — investigative techniques never used with Clinton.\\nThat NARA prompted the investigation of Trump and the use of a grand jury proves especially suspect given that Ferriero led the agency at the time and later admitted to retiring to ensure President Biden could choose his successor, suggesting a partisan heartbeat inside the bureaucrat. Ferriero also called Jan. 6 the worst day of his life and claimed when he saw Trump leaving the White House for the last time with a box, he asked himself, “What the hell’s in that box?” Such a response suggests a case of Trump Derangement Syndrome — something seen throughout the Crossfire Hurricane investigation too.\\n10. A Quick Denial Before Downplaying the Problem\\nA 10th similarly seen between the Russia-collusion hoax and the latest crusade to crush Trump involves the media’s penchant for denying charges against the government only later to downplay what agents did. With Crossfire Hurricane, you saw the press denying that any spying took place on Trump or his campaign. But once it came out that the government had a confidential human source record conversations with members of the Trump campaign and that an FBI agent presented a briefing for Trump and Flynn as part of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, the media spun the significance of those revelations by framing them as “not spying.”\\nLess than two weeks into the latest investigation of Trump, the press is putting on a repeat performance as seen by the immediate denial of Trump’s claim that the FBI seized his passports. But when the government admitted to taking Trump’s passports by mistake, the press merely spun the story as a mistake promptly corrected.\\nThe DOJ and FBI, however, are making a bigger mistake: They continue to think they can execute the same game plan they did for the last six years without the public seeing the similarities. They can’t, and the widespread backlash to the search proves Americans refuse to be fooled again.\\nMargot Cleveland is The Federalist's senior legal correspondent.

Two such accusations were published in The New York Times, including one from a woman who said Trump groped her breasts and attempted to put his hand up her skirt during a first-class flight to New York in the early 1980s.\\n“The phony story in the failing @nytimes is a TOTAL FABRICATION. Written by same people as last discredited story on woman. WATCH!” Trump tweeted Thursday morning.\\nHe went on a rant during an afternoon rally in West Palm Beach, Florida, reading off a teleprompter as he claimed “these were nothing more than false smears,” “these claims are all fabricated” and “these events never, ever happened.”\\nTrump attacked the integrity of his female accusers, saying “You take a look at these people … and you’ll understand also.”\\nBefore a riled-up crowd, Trump continued, calling the allegations “preposterous” and “ludicrous.” “We already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies, and it will be made public in an appropriate way and at an appropriate time, very soon,” he added.\\nIn the other allegation published by The New York Times, a then-22-year-old receptionist recalled introducing herself to Trump outside a Trump Tower elevator in 2005. She said Trump shook her hand but then refused to let go as he proceeded to kiss her on the cheeks and then on the mouth. The allegation is similar to what Trump said on the now infamous 2005 tape, when he told Billy Bush of “Access Hollywood” that, “You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait.”\\nIn a statement, Trump’s senior communications adviser Jason Miller wrote Wednesday night that the entire New York Times report was “fiction” and accused the newspaper of launching “a completely false, coordinated character assassination against Mr. Trump.”\\nIn a letter to the Times demanding a retraction, Trump’s attorney wrote that the article is “reckless, defamatory and constitutes libel per se.” The former reality TV star’s lawyer threatened to pursue “all available actions and remedies” if the newspaper refused to retract the story and apologize. Attorneys for the Times responded Thursday afternoon, declining the lawyer’s demand by writing that “nothing in our article has had the slightest effect on the reputation that Mr. Trump, through his own words and actions, has already created for himself.”\\n“If Mr. Trump disagrees, if he believes that American citizens had no right to hear what these women had to say and that the law of this country forces us and those who would dare criticize him to stand silent or be punished, we welcome the opportunity to have a court set him straight,” the newspaper’s attorney added.\\nThe candidate’s son Donald Trump Jr. called the Times’ story “a typical New York Times smear campaign” and said that he had “never heard anything dumber in my life,” in an interview with Charlotte radio station WBT. He also tried to put a positive spin on the remarks Trump made on the “Access Hollywood” hot microphone in 2005, suggesting that such comments indicated that his father was “human.”\\n“I’ve had conversations like that with plenty of people where people use language off-color. They’re talking, two guys, amongst themselves. I’ve seen it time and time again. I think it makes him a human,” the younger Trump said. “I think it makes him a normal person, not a political robot. He hasn’t spent his whole life waiting for this moment to run for the presidency.”\\nThe report published by the Times did not include the only such allegations of sexual assault to emerge on Wednesday. Hours after the Times report was published, People magazine writer Natasha Stoynoff offeredher own account of Trump forcibly kissing her in 2005 at his Mar-a-Lago resort, where she was scheduled to interview the mogul about his first year of marriage to Melania Trump. Stoynoff said in her article that she hadn’t included the incident in her original story for People because she “doubted my recollection and my reaction” and was “afraid that a famous, powerful, wealthy man could and would discredit and destroy me, especially if I got his coveted PEOPLE feature killed.”\\nA Trump campaign spokeswoman said Stoynoff’s allegation was “fabricated.” Trump himself tweeted on Thursday morning, “Why didn’t the writer of the twelve year old article in People Magazine mention the ‘incident’ in her story. Because it did not happen!”\\nThe Trump campaign said the claims of a fourth woman, who told The Palm Beach Post that Trump groped her 13 years ago, also at Mar-a-Lago, lack “any merit or veracity.” The billionaire is also facing an allegation from Cassandra Searles, Miss Washington 2013, whom Rolling Stone reports as saying, “He probably doesn’t want me telling the story about that time he continually grabbed my ass and invited me to his hotel room.”\\nAnd then there’s a CBS report on a 1992 “Entertainment Tonight” Christmas feature at Trump Tower in which Trump allegedly said he would be dating one of the young girls in 10 years. Trump asks one of the girls in the video if she’s “going up the escalator.” The girl replies, “Yeah,” and Trump turns to the camera and says: “I am going to be dating her in 10 years. Can you believe it?”\\nThe women in The New York Times, Palm Beach Post and People reports all said they were motivated to speak after Trump denied at Sunday’s presidential debate that he had ever actually carried out the actions he described in the 2005 recording. But Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson offered an alternate theory, that the women were making public their allegations now “because 15 minutes of fame.”\\nIn a powerful and emotional rebuke to Trump, first lady Michelle Obama said Thursday that his vulgar comments on sexual assault “have shaken me to my core,” and she called on women to rise up against the Republican nominee.\\n“The fact is in this election we have a candidate for president of the United States who over the course of his lifetime and the course of this campaign has said things about women that are so shocking, so demeaning, I simply will not repeat anything here today,” she said during a rally for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire. “And last week we saw this candidate actually bragging about sexually assaulting women. I can’t believe I’m saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women.”\\nHer voice breaking at times, Obama went on to say, “I listen to all of this and I feel it so personally, and I’m sure that many of you do, too, particularly the women,” adding, “The shameful comments about our bodies, the disrespect of our intelligence. The belief you can do anything to a woman? It is cruel. It’s frightening. And the truth is, it hurts. It hurts.”\\nBut Trump’s surrogates forcefully tried to dispute the allegations, with former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, now a paid contributor on CNN, telling “New Day” that he suspected the accusations were politically motivated.\\n“If this incident had been so important to them, they could have — alleged incidents — it could have talked about this many, many, many times, many opportunities,” he said. “Look, you have an accusation from a reporter right now that has access to the media anytime they wanted to, to raise this issue should it have been an issue that she wanted to discuss.”\\n“I find it a little egregious that because Anderson [Cooper, the debate co-moderator] asked a question and they didn’t like his answer after all of the other things, that they decide now this is my impetus to come forward,” he continued. “That is Sunday. Today is now Thursday. It took them four days?”\\nTrump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, had a harder time defending her boss over aBuzzFeed report that the former pageant owner would walk into a dressing room while contestants were changing. The GOP nominee admitted in a 2005 interview with “The Howard Stern Show” that because he owned the pageant, he was allowed to enter the dressing room and ogle the women inside.\\n“I am allowed to go in because I am the owner of the pageant,” he told Stern. “They’re standing there with no clothes. Is everybody OK? You see these incredible-looking women. I sort of get away with things like that.”\\n“You want me to comment on something he said to Howard Stern in 15 seconds 10 years ago and that somehow I am an expert on it,” Conway said when CNN anchor Brianna Keilar played the radio show clip for her during an interview Wednesday, instead accusing the network of covering only negative stories about Trump at the expense of stories that reflect badly on Clinton.\\n“The fact is that all you want to do, it seems, is talk about something he said 10, 15 years ago and, yet, we never, ever want to talk, particularly CNN when we offered up these women to you,” Conway said. “We never want to talk to the women shamed and blamed by Hillary Clinton because they had sexual contact with her husband. Some consensual longtime affairs including in the White House and other victims of predatory conduct.”\\nThe new allegations threaten to further damage an already collapsing relationship between Trump and Republican leaders. House Speaker Paul Ryan on Monday declared that he would no longer campaign for the Republican nominee, which appeared to enrage Trump. The nominee has repeatedly laced into Ryan on the campaign trail, accusing Republican leaders of engaging in a “sinister deal” against him.\\nBut Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich on Thursday morning said such attacks were foolhardy and beneath Trump.\\n“Look, first of all, let me just say about Trump, who I admire and I’ve tried to help as much as I can. There’s a big Trump and a little Trump,” Gingrich said on Fox Business in a comment that evoked Trump’s slam on Sen. Marco Rubio as “Little Marco.” “The little Trump is frankly pathetic. I mean, he’s mad over not getting a phone call?”\\nTrump at a rally in Florida on Wednesday lashed out at Ryan for not offering congratulations after Sunday night’s debate. “Instead of calling me and saying, ‘Congratulations, you did a great job, you absolutely destroyed her in the debate like everybody said,’” Trump said, as he went on to bemoan other ways he’s been jilted this election.\\nGingrich said Thursday that Trump needs to focus his energy on Hillary Clinton and to stop being distracted.\\n“Donald Trump has one opponent. Her name is Hillary Clinton. Her name is not Paul Ryan. It’s not anybody else,” he said.'], 'https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/12/14/republicans-in-key-battleground-states-create-alternate-slate-of-electors-to-keep-trumps-legal-challenges-afloat/': ['breitbart.com', \"Republicans in Key Battlegrounds Create 'Alternate Slate of Electors'\", 'Hannah Bleau', datetime.datetime(2020, 12, 14, 22, 13, 58), 'Republicans are creating “alternate” slates of electoral votes in contested battleground states in the event of a challenge of the presidential election results on the House floor — a move President Trump’s senior advisor Stephen Miller previewed on Monday.\\nElectors across the country are meeting in their respective states to formally cast their votes for the 2020 presidential election, as is Constitutionally required.

One, from Telemundo, had Trump winning by a 2-to-1 margin, he said. Another, from WGN, had a similarly lopsided result. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight “Early reviews, instant response, instant polls,” Hannity said. “I’m sure the, you know, the mainstream media will have corrupt polls, as they always do, but those are the two flash polls that we have already.”\\nThe press secretary Trump formally employs made a similar argument on Twitter.\\nVERDICT: President @realDonaldTrump WINS ‼️\\nCSPAN: ✅ Trump (53% Trump; 29% Biden)\\nTelemundo: ✅ Trump (66% Trump; 34% Biden)\\nCNN: ✅ Trump (3 votes Trump; 1 vote Biden of decided voters) pic.twitter.com/eCaskcjTNk — Kayleigh McEnany (@kayleighmcenany) September 30, 2020\\nThe thing about those surveys is that they are garbage. This isn’t meant as disparagement; it’s meant as an accurate reflection of the utility of a survey that consists of a media outlet such as C-SPAN asking people on Twitter whom they think won. A good rule of thumb for a poll is that if anyone can weigh in on it and can encourage other people to participate as well, it’s not going to yield a useful result. When Telemundo announced the results of its informal Twitter survey, it deliberately pointed out that the results weren’t scientific, slightly moderating the uselessness of sharing such information in the first place.\\nAdvertisement\\nHannity, of course, offered no such qualifier — instead disparaging mainstream media polls that he certainly knew would be less generous in their assessments of the results. (If you enjoy watching Hannity amplify uninformative results to make a political point while we wait for more accurate results to come in, you’re going to want to watch Fox News on election night.)\\nIn short order, scientific polls from reputable outlets were released. While White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany decided to share the results of a CNN reporter asking an on-air focus group whom they planned to support, the network’s actual poll, conducted with SSRS, offered a much bleaker review of Trump’s performance.\\nSixty percent of respondents in CNN’s real poll thought that former vice president Joe Biden won the debate. Only 28 percent thought that Trump did.\\nCNN had asked its respondents before the debate whom they expected to win. Biden had the advantage there, too, by 13 points. Tellingly, Trump was far less likely to have been declared the winner than respondents expected, across party groups. Nearly 9 in 10 Republicans expected Trump to win, for example, but only about two-thirds actually did. Fully a quarter of Republicans thought Biden won, as did 1 in 8 Trump supporters.\\nIt’s worth noting that this was a particularly friendly group of respondents. The network’s David Chalian noted in CNN’s broadcast that the pool of those interviewed skewed more heavily Democratic. That’s probably one reason, coming into the debate, 6 in 10 had favorable views of Biden compared to 4 in 10 who said the same of Trump. After the debate, there wasn’t much change — some slight shifts that aren’t statistically significant.\\nA poll released by CBS News and conducted by YouGov had a narrower margin of victory for Biden, with 48 percent viewing him as the winner and 41 percent saying that Trump prevailed.\\nThe pollsters also asked respondents, both before and after the debate, how they viewed the candidates on three qualities: physical and mental stamina, honesty or trustworthiness, and the extent to which the candidates seemed to care about voters like them. The debate did little to change people’s views of Trump or Biden on these measures, with Trump maintaining an advantage on stamina and Biden being viewed as more honest and caring.\\nThis is obviously a less clear-cut result than the one CNN offers, but the implication is the same: In a moment in which Trump very much needed a victory to redirect the course of a race that he’s losing, it seems unlikely that he did. His allies can lift up random Twitter polls to argue that he won, but that will probably serve only to bolster the confidence of his existing base of support, not to actually convince undecided voters that he triumphed.\\nParticularly because, in that CBS-YouGov poll, respondents were more likely to say that their view of Biden improved than worsened — and to say the opposite of Trump.\\nOver time, as more polls come out evaluating the debate and the race, we’ll have a better sense for what Tuesday night meant. We nonetheless focus on this “who won” question because it seems concrete, a tick forward in the long contest between the candidates. But a debate in which Trump didn’t clearly advance relative to Biden is a loss for the president.\\nNo matter what Hannity says Telemundo said.\\nGiftOutline Gift Article'], 'https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa/trump-says-summit-removed-north-korean-nuclear-threat-democrats-doubtful-idUSKBN1J90CA': ['reuters.com', 'Trump says summit removed North Korean nuclear threat, but Democrats doubtful', 'David Brunnstrom, Steve Holland', datetime.datetime(2018, 6, 13, 3, 46, 11), 'SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that North Korea no longer posed a nuclear threat and his top diplomat offered a hopeful timeline for “major disarmament,” despite skepticism at home that Pyongyang will abandon its nuclear weapons following this week’s summit.\\nTrump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued a joint statement after their historic meeting in Singapore on Tuesday that reaffirmed the North’s commitment to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” and gave U.S. guarantees of security to North Korea.\\nDemocratic critics in the United States said the agreement was short on detail and the Republican president had made too many concessions to Kim, whose country is under U.N. sanctions for its nuclear and weapons programs and is widely condemned for human rights abuses.\\nJust over half of Americans approve of how Trump has handled North Korea, but only a quarter think the summit will lead to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Wednesday.\\nNorth Korea’s state media hailed the summit as a success, including highlighting Trump’s surprise announcement after the meeting that the United States would stop military exercises with South Korea, which the North has long sought.\\nDespite the lack of detail in the summit agreement, Trump stressed at a news conference afterward that he trusted Kim to follow through.

Donald Trump is the clear front-runner but not the inevitable nominee — yet.\\nIn a normal election year we\\'d say someone who won the New Hampshire primaries by a yuuuuge margin and the South Carolina primary by 10 points is the clear front-runner. No Republican candidate has won both those primaries and not gone on to become the nominee. That being said, this is not a typical election year, and there are many Republicans who think either — a.) it\\'s just not possible for Trump to be the nominee, or b.) it would be a calamity for the party\\'s brand and down-ballot prospects if he became the nominee.\\n2. The GOP establishment doesn\\'t seem to have a game plan to take on Trump.\\nThe GOP establishment has taken Trump on in fits and starts. Jeb Bush fell on his sword trying to undermine Trump. Trump and Ted Cruz have been battling for similar slices of the vote in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina with Cruz making ideological attacks — accusing Trump of not being a \"real conservative.\" That hasn\\'t worked. Now a variety of superPACs are trying, with one pro-Rubio superPAC airing a new attack ad that takes aim at Trump\\'s temperament, calling him erratic. Polls show Trump\\'s biggest weakness is his temperament, but so far nothing the other candidates have said or done has dented his lead.\\nYouTube\\n3. Now that Bush is out, which candidate will fight Trump?\\nOne of the biggest mysteries of the race is why Marco Rubio hasn\\'t taken on Trump. So far, Rubio has avoided the kind of frontal attack on Trump that backfired on Bush. Rubio has been busy fighting with Cruz and has yet to repeat Bush\\'s criticism that Trump is intolerant and divisive. The longer this race goes on with more than two candidates in it, the better it is for Trump. Some polls show that either Cruz or Rubio could beat Trump if it were a two-man race, but neither Rubio nor Cruz has an incentive to drop out anytime soon. And those head-to-heads can and will change as more people quit.\\n4. Trump\\'s argument\\nTrump argues that as those candidates drop out, he\\'ll inherit some of their support as well. And he suggests that the GOP establishment should quit carping about him. After all, he is bringing new voters into the party, particularly non-college-educated white men. Republicans have had record-breaking turnouts in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, and Trump can certainly take some credit for that.\\nDespite Trump\\'s terrible approval ratings with minorities, Trump\\'s appeal to blue-collar voters could theoretically put states in play such as Pennsylvania and Michigan, and maybe improve the GOP\\'s chances in Ohio.\\nBut he hasn\\'t convinced the Republican establishment of that yet.'], 'https://thehill.com/homenews/media/453331-merriam-webster-trolls-brit-hume-for-citing-its-first-definition-of-racism-in': ['thehill.com', 'Merriam-Webster appears to jab Brit Hume for citing its first definition of racism to defend Trump', 'Morgan Gstalter, Hours Ago, Pm Et, Days Ago, Am Et', datetime.datetime(2019, 7, 16, 18, 25, 5), 'The official Twitter account for Merriam-Webster Dictionary appeared to jab Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume on Tuesday for citing its first definition of racism to defend President Trump’s tweets about Democratic congresswomen of color.\\nHume took to Twitter on Monday to condemn the president’s tweets, which said the congresswomen should “go back” to other countries, writing that they were “nativist, xenophobic, counterfactual and politically stupid,” but not racist.\\nHe defended his stance by pointing “definition 1” under “racism” on Merriam-Webster’s website.\\nFor those who asked what is my standard definition of racism, here is an answer: Note definition 1. https://t.co/4kPRE3wDA7 — Brit Hume (@brithume) July 15, 2019\\nThe first definition reads: “a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race.”\\nThe dictionary’s social media account, on Monday, appeared to call out the Fox News host for not reading on for more information.{mosads}\\n“Many of our entries have helpful usage notes if you scroll farther than the first definition,” Merriam-Webster wrote.\\nThe image includes a paragraph farther down on the webpage to which Hume linked, which says that “dictionaries are often treated as the final arbiter in arguments over a word’s meaning, but they are not always well suited for settling disputes.”\\n“The lexicographer’s role is to explain how words are (or have been) actually used, not how some may feel that they should be used, and they say nothing about the intrinsic nature of the thing named by a word, much less the significance it may have for individuals,” the website states.\\nMerriam-Webster notes that while discussing concepts like racism, it is “prudent” to recognize that simply quoting the dictionary “is unlikely to either mollify or persuade the person with whom one is arguing.”\\nMany of our entries have helpful usage notes if you scroll farther than the first definition. pic.twitter.com/a91ezmH9rW — Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) July 15, 2019\\nTrump sparked outrage Sunday morning when he tweeted that unidentified progressive congresswomen “who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe” should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.”\\nHe did not identify to whom he was referring, but the comments were widely interpreted as targeting Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (Minn.), Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) and Ayanna Pressley (Mass.), all four of whom are U.S. citizens.\\nDemocrats have blasted Trump for using a racist trope, and a handful of Republicans, including Reps. Will Hurd (Texas) and Michael Turner (Ohio), have described the language as racist, though most Republicans have stopped short of using the term explicitly.\\nThe president now faces an upcoming House vote to explicitly condemn the tweets as racist.\\nThe text of the resolution, which is sponsored by freshman Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), states that the House “strongly condemns President Donald Trump’s racist comments that have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color by saying that our fellow Americans who are immigrants, and those who may look to the President like immigrants, should ‘go back’ to other countries.”\\nThe resolution also states that the House “believes that immigrants and their descendants have made America stronger, and that those who take the oath of citizenship are every bit as American as those whose families have lived in the United States for many generations” and “is committed to keeping America open to those lawfully seeking refuge and asylum from violence and oppression, and those who are willing to work hard to live the American Dream, no matter their race, ethnicity, faith, or country of origin.”']}\n"

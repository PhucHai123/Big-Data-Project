        "## Analyzing News Articles With Python (Part 1)\n",
        "\n",
        "*By Andre Sealy (Updated 6/21/2020)*\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the first part of what I believe to be a multi-part series in analyzing news articles on Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Never before has America become more polarized than we are today. As such, the news we consume is a function of our polarization. Right-leaning people tend to get their information from Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, National Review, etc. People who lean left tend to get their information from MSNBC, The New York Times, The Huffington Post, etc. There are a handful of neutral publications (Reuters, Politico, Associated Press, etc.). Still, even their alignment falls into question, based on how they report the news.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project will attempt to analyze how polarizing mainstream articles are for stories typical in the U.S. news cycle, as well as measuring the sentiment for each item. To help guide us for this project, we will be using the website All Sides.\n",
        "\n",
        "### All Sides News Aggregator\n",
        "\n",
        "All Sides is a bipartisan organization that looks at a more balanced approach to news coverage by collecting the top headlines of the day and showcasing the reporting of the news outlet on the left, right, and center. The platform also allows readers the rate the lean of the publication for further analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Importing the Modules\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's begin to load the necessary modules for the project, which include the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **requests**\n",
        "* **BeautifulSoup**\n",
        "* **csv**\n",
        "* **re**\n",
        "* **socket**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `requests` module allows you to send HTTP requests using Python, which will enable you to inspect the structure of many different websites. From there, you will be able to scrape the relevant information of the website with the `BeautifulSoup` module. Regular Expressions or the `re` module allows Python to look for specific text that follows a particular pattern. (doing this technique several times, you'll soon realize that certain outlets follow a pattern when publishing articles) \n",
        "\n",
        "The `csv` module will just allow us to create and save our information to a csv for further analysis later on. There is nothing reall important about the `socket` module; it's used just in case we run into an error during the extraction process."
